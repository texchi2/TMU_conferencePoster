abstract = {Correlation in the broadest sense is a measure of an association between variables. In correlated data, the change in the magnitude of 1 variable is associated with a change in the magnitude of another variable, either in the same (positive correlation) or in the opposite (negative correlation) direction. Most often, the term correlation is used in the context of a linear relationship between 2 continuous variables and expressed as Pearson product-moment correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient is typically used for jointly normally distributed data (data that follow a bivariate normal distribution). For nonnormally distributed continuous data, for ordinal data, or for data with relevant outliers, a Spearman rank correlation can be used as a measure of a monotonic association. Both correlation coefficients are scaled such that they range from –1 to +1, where 0 indicates that there is no linear or monotonic association, and the relationship gets stronger and ultimately approaches a straight line (Pearson correlation) or a constantly increasing or decreasing curve (Spearman correlation) as the coefficient approaches an absolute value of 1. Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be used to address the statistical significance of the results and to estimate the strength of the relationship in the population from which the data were sampled. The aim of this tutorial is to guide researchers and clinicians in the appropriate use and interpretation of correlation coefficients. (Anesth Analg 2018;126:1763–8.},

abstract = {Among all malignancies, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in  China. Bone metastasis is one of the most common complications and one of the most important factors affecting the prognosis of lung cancer patients, which resulting in very poor therapeutic effects. Previously, we have demonstrated that the expression levels of Dickkopf1 (DKK1), a protein involved in cell regulation and proliferation, was dramatically higher in cells that have a tendency to metastasize and invade the bone tissue (SBC-5 cells) compared with cells that do not (SBC-3 cells). Downregulation of DKK1 in SBC-5 cells inhibited cell malignancy in vitro, and the formation of bone metastasis in vivo. However, whether upregulating DKK1 would be sufficient to induce aggressive tumor behavior (proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis) in SBC-3 cells remained to be investigated. The present study aimed to examine the role of DKK1 in SBC-3 cells, as well as to investigate the SBC-3 ability to metastasize and invade the bone tissue. The results demonstrated that upregulation of DKK1 in SBC-3 cells enhanced cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration and invasion in vitro, as well as bone metastasis in vivo. These results indicate that DKK1 may be an important regulator in the development of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and targeting DKK1 may be an effective method for preventing and/or treating skeletal metastases in SCLC cases.},

@article{Benjamini1995a,
abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Objectives: The purpose of this study is to test the psychometric properties and validity of the unconditional positive self-regard scale (UPSR) and its two subscales developed by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). It also aims to examine and compare the concepts of UPSR with self-compassion and its relation to mental well-being. Design: Correlation survey design validations of the UPSR scale (Patterson {\&} Joseph, 2006). Methods: The validation was conducted using an undergraduate and postgraduate student opportunity sample, n = 179. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha and inter-item correlations. Convergent and divergent validity was explored in terms of correlations with self-compassion, depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scales. Results: There was good internal consistency for both the UPSR scale and the self-regard subscale and somewhat questionable internal consistency for the conditionality subscale. Overall the scale appears to be relatively consistent, supporting the previous findings reported by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). The results supported the hypothesis that UPSR is positively correlated with a measure of self-compassion and negatively correlated with measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Conclusions: The UPSR scale is a valid measure of the person-centred concept of unconditional positive self-regard. This supports the potential use of the UPSR scale for evaluating therapeutic change for client-centred practitioners through the use of this non-medicalized tool.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Dickkopf1 (DKK1) gene encodes a protein that belongs to the Dickkopf family. The protein can inhibit the Wnt signaling pathway which plays a key role in the carcinogenesis and progression of various types of cancers. Based on this, we hypothesized that the differential expression of DKK1 may figure significantly in cancers by regulating Wnt signaling pathway transduction. In this study, we conducted bioinformatics analysis to evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of DKK1 expression level in human cancers. METHODS: The expression level was analyzed by using the Oncomine database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis tool. The analysis of prognosis was conducted by using the UALCAN, Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and DriverDBv3 databases. We also investigated using DKK1 promoter methylation to define cancer types through the UALCAN database. Meanwhile, the related functional networks of DKK1 were analyzed by using the GeneMANIA interactive tool and Cytoscape software. Furthermore, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis was conducted using the Metascape online website, and we used the cBioPotartal database to explored DKK1 expression, aberrant information, and the co-expression genes in the subgroups of lung cancer. Finally, we performed the overall survival (OS) meta-analysis of the DKK1 expression in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) via the Lung Cancer Explorer (LCE). RESULTS: DKK1 was differentially expressed in different types of human cancers. DKK1 was overexpressed in human cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), LUSC, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Overexpression of DKK1 indicated adverse OS in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), HNSC, and PADD, but no difference in OS was found between the LUSC and healthy groups. The high expression of DKK1 was also associated with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) in HNSC, LUSC, and PAAD. Gene regulation network analysis indicated that DKK1 was mainly involved in Wnt signaling pathways and several other signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that DKK1 is significantly expressed in various cancers and could be a biomarker for targeted therapy and a predictor for prognosis of these specific cancers. The bioinformatics analysis revealed a significant overexpression of DKK1 in HNSC, LUSC, and PAAD, with DKK1 overexpression being associated with adverse outcome in these patients, but how DKK1 expression levels relate to hematological malignancies and prognosis is still unclear. These new insights into the function of DKK1 may provide a basis for new targeted drug therapy and an avenue for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis of DKK1 in different cancer types.},

abstract = {Purpose: To determine if gene expression signature of invasive oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) can subclassify OSCC based on survival. Experimental Design: We analyzed the expression of 131 genes in 119 OSCC, 35 normal, and 17 dysplastic mucosa to identify cluster-defined subgroups. Multivariate Cox regression was used to estimate the association between gene expression and survival. By stepwise Cox regression, the top predictive models of OSCC-specific survival were determined and compared by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: The 3-year overall mean ± SE survival for a cluster of 45 OSCC patients was 38.7 ± 0.09{\%} compared with 69,1 ± 0.08{\%} for the remaining patients. Multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex, and stage showed that the 45 OSCC patient cluster had worse overall and OSCC- specific survival (hazard ratio, 3,31; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.66-6.58 and hazard ratio, 5,43; 95{\%} confidence interval, 2.32-12.73, respectively). Stepwise Cox regression on the131 probe sets revealed that a model with a term for LAMC2 (laminin $\gamma$ 2) gene expression best identified patients with worst OSCC-specific survival. We fit a Cox model with a term for a principal component analysis-derived risk score marker and two other models that combined stage with either LAMC2 or PCA. The area under the curve for models combining stage with either LAMC2 or PCA was 0,80 or 0.82, respectively, compared with 0.70 for stage alone (P = 0.013 and 0.008, respectively). Conclusions: Gene expression and stage combined predict survival of OSCC patients better than stage alone. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.},

abstract = {RNAseq and microarray methods are frequently used to measure gene expression level. While similar in purpose, there are fundamental differences between the two technologies. Here, we present the largest comparative study between microarray and RNAseq methods to date using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found high correlations between expression data obtained from the Affymetrix one-channel microarray and RNAseq (Spearman correlations coefficients of ∼0.8). We also observed that the low abundance genes had poorer correlations between microarray and RNAseq data than high abundance genes. As expected, due to measurement and normalization differences, Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data were poorly correlated (Spearman correlations coefficients of only ∼0.2). By examining the differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples we observed reasonable concordance in directionality between Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data, although a small group of genes were found to have expression changes reported in opposite directions using these two technologies. Overall, RNAseq produces comparable results to microarray technologies in term of expression profiling. The RNAseq normalization methods RPKM and RSEM produce similar results on the gene level and reasonably concordant results on the exon level. Longer exons tended to have better concordance between the two normalization methods than shorter exons.},

abstract = {Stress-induced immune dysregulation results in significant health consequences for immune related disorders including viral infections, chronic autoimmune disease, and tumor growth and metastasis. In this mini-review we discuss the sympathetic, neuroendocrine and immunologic mechanisms by which psychosocial stress can impact cancer biology. Both human and animal studies have shown the sympathetic and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress significantly impacts cancer, in part, through regulation of inflammatory mediators. Psychosocial stressors stimulate neuroendocrine, sympathetic, and immune responses that result in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the subsequent regulation of inflammatory responses by immune cells. Social disruption (SDR) stress, a murine model of psychosocial stress and repeated social defeat, provides a novel and powerful tool to probe the mechanisms leading to stress-induced alterations in inflammation, tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In this review, we will focus on SDR as an important model of psychosocial stress in understanding neural-immune mechanisms in cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Background: Adverse psychosocial exposures in early life, namely experiences such as child maltreatment, caregiver stress or depression, and domestic or community violence, have been associated in epidemiological studies with increased lifetime risk of adverse outcomes, including diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and psychiatric illnesses. Additional work has shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms by which early adversity becomes "biologically embedded" in altered physiology across body systems. This review surveys evidence on such mechanisms and calls on researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and other practitioners to act upon evidence. Observations: Childhood psychosocial adversity has wide-ranging effects on neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic physiology. Molecular mechanisms broadly implicate disruption of central neural networks, neuroendocrine stress dysregulation, and chronic inflammation, among other changes. Physiological disruption predisposes individuals to common diseases across the life course. Conclusions: Reviewed evidence has important implications for clinical practice, biomedical research, and work across other sectors relevant to public health and child wellbeing. Warranted changes include increased clinical screening for exposures among children and adults, scale-up of effective interventions, policy advocacy, and ongoing research to develop new evidence-based response strategies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: With the continued improvement of requisite mass spectrometers and UHPLC systems, Hydrogen/Deuterium eXchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) workflows are rapidly evolving towards the investigation of more challenging biological systems, including large protein complexes and membrane proteins. The analysis of such extensive systems results in very large HDX-MS datasets for which specific analysis tools are required to speed up data validation and interpretation. RESULTS: We introduce a web application and a new R-package named 'MEMHDX' to help users analyze, validate and visualize large HDX-MS datasets. MEMHDX is composed of two elements. A statistical tool aids in the validation of the results by applying a mixed-effects model for each peptide, in each experimental condition, and at each time point, taking into account the time dependency of the HDX reaction and number of independent replicates. Two adjusted P-values are generated per peptide, one for the 'Change in dynamics' and one for the 'Magnitude of DeltaD', and are used to classify the data by means of a 'Logit' representation. A user-friendly interface developed with Shiny by RStudio facilitates the use of the package. This interactive tool allows the user to easily and rapidly validate, visualize and compare the relative deuterium incorporation on the amino acid sequence and 3D structure, providing both spatial and temporal information.

abstract = {Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91; 95{\%} CI 5 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86; 95{\%} CI 5 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.},

abstract = {Radiation therapy (RT) plays a major role in the management of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Despite therapeutic and technological advances, some patients will have persistence of irradiated tumor or develop locoregional failure, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality [1]. Radioresistance is a broad term that describes the relative resistance of individual cells, tissues, organs, or entire organisms to the biologic effects of RT [2]. Mechanisms of radioresistance to RT in head and neck cancer and strategies used to overcome this resistance are discussed here. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is discussed in detail separately. (See "Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Approaches combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy" and "Definitive radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Dose and fractionation considerations".)},

abstract = {Aims: Chronic stress plays an important role in promoting the progression and migration of cancers. However, little is known of any direct impact on tumor progression related to the regulation of emotion-related circuitry. The aim of this study was to explore the neural-circuit mechanisms underlying stress-induced progression of cancers and the impact of emotion-related regulation of circuitry on tumor growth. Methods: Optogenetic manipulation was applied to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)–treated mice bearing breast tumor cell. The stress-related hormones, tumor-related cytokines, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–positive neurons and their fibers, dopamine receptor–positive cells, and anxiety level were measured using ELISA, immunohistochemical staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and behavioral test, respectively. Results: By investigating breast cancer mouse models with a chronic mild stress model, optogenetic stimulation, and behavioral analysis, we show that chronic stress induced anxiety-like behavior in mice and increased serum concentration of norepinephrine and corticosterone, hormones closely related to stress and anxiety. Optogenetic activation of VTA TH terminals in the mPFC rescued anxiety-like behavior induced by chronic stress. Chronic stress resulted in marked progression of breast tumors, and repetitive optogenetic activation of VTA TH terminals in the mPFC significantly attenuated stress-induced progression of breast cancers and reduced serum concentration of norepinephrine and corticosterone. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between serum norepinephrine or corticosterone concentration and tumor size. Conclusions: These findings indicate a positive role of an emotion regulation circuit on the progression of breast cancer and reveal a link between stress, emotion regulation, and the progression of breast cancers. Our findings provide new insights pertinent to therapeutic interventions in the treatment of breast cancers.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved. The Cancer Genome Atlas profiled 279 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) to provide a comprehensive landscape of somatic genomic alterations. Here we show that human-papillomavirus-associated tumours are dominated by helical domain mutations of the oncogene PIK3CA, novel alterations involving loss of TRAF3, and amplification of the cell cycle gene E2F1. Smoking-related HNSCCs demonstrate near universal loss-of-function TP53 mutations and CDKN2A inactivation with frequent copy number alterations including amplification of 3q26/28 and 11q13/22. A subgroup of oral cavity tumours with favourable clinical outcomes displayed infrequent copy number alterations in conjunction with activating mutations of HRAS or PIK3CA, coupled with inactivating mutations of CASP8, NOTCH1 and TP53. Other distinct subgroups contained loss-of-function alterations of the chromatin modifier NSD1, WNT pathway genes AJUBA and FAT1, and activation of oxidative stress factor NFE2L2, mainly in laryngeal tumours. Therapeutic candidate alterations were identified in most HNSCCs.},

Published genome-wide profiling studies of HNSCC3,4 are limited 
to single platforms. To generate an integrated genomic annotation of 
molecular alterations in HNSCC, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
has undertaken a comprehensive multi-platform characterization of 
500 tumours with the a priori hypothesis of detecting somatic variants 
present in at least 5{\%} of samples. Here, we report the results for ana- 
lyses from the first 279 patients with complete data},

abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: When designing an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation (DNAm) and some exposure(s) or phenotype(s), it is critically important to assess the sample size needed to detect a hypothesized difference with adequate statistical power. However, the complex and nuanced nature of DNAm data makes direct assessment of statistical power challenging. To circumvent these challenges and to address the outstanding need for a user-friendly interface for EWAS power evaluation, we have developed pwrEWAS. RESULTS: The current implementation of pwrEWAS accommodates power estimation for two-group comparisons of DNAm (e.g. case vs control, exposed vs non-exposed, etc.), where methylation assessment is carried out using the Illumina Human Methylation BeadChip technology. Power is calculated using a semi-parametric simulation-based approach in which DNAm data is randomly generated from beta-distributions using CpG-specific means and variances estimated from one of several different existing DNAm data sets, chosen to cover the most common tissue-types used in EWAS. In addition to specifying the tissue type to be used for DNAm profiling, users are required to specify the sample size, number of differentially methylated CpGs, effect size(s) (Deltabeta), target false discovery rate (FDR) and the number of simulated data sets, and have the option of selecting from several different statistical methods to perform differential methylation analyses. pwrEWAS reports the marginal power, marginal type I error rate, marginal FDR, and false discovery cost (FDC). Here, we demonstrate how pwrEWAS can be applied in practice using a hypothetical EWAS. In addition, we report its computational efficiency across a variety of user settings.

abstract = {Purpose: To identify a prognostic gene signature for patients with human papilloma virus (HPV)- negative oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC). Experimental Design: Two gene expression datasets were used: a training dataset from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC, Seattle, WA; n = 97) and a validation dataset from the MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC, Houston, TX; n = 71). We applied L1/L2-penalized Cox regression models to the FHCRC data on the 131-gene signature previously identified to be prognostic in patients with OSCCs to identify a prognostic model specific for patients with high-risk HPV-negative OSCCs. The models were tested with the MDACC dataset using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: A 13-gene model was identified as the best predictor of HPV-negative OSCC-specific survival in the training dataset. The risk score for each patient in the validation dataset was calculated from this model and dichotomized at the median. The estimated 2-year mortality (±SE) of patients with high-risk scores was 47.1{\%} (±9.24{\%}) compared with 6.35{\%} (±4.42) for patients with low-risk scores. ROC analyses showed that the areas under the curve for the age, gender, and treatment modality-adjusted models with risk score [0.78; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.74-0.86] and risk score plus tumor stage (0.79; 95{\%} CI, 0.75-0.87) were substantially higher than for the model with tumor stage (0.54; 95{\%} CI, 0.48-0.62). Conclusions: We identified and validated a 13-gene signature that is considerably better than tumor stage in predicting survival of patients with HPV-negative OSCCs. Further evaluation of this gene signature as a prognostic marker in other populations of patients with HPV-negative OSCC is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Association for Cancer Research.},

A general pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that cancer patients have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment.

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has a poor survival rate mainly due to late stage diagnosis and recurrence. Despite genomic efforts to identify driver mutations and changes in protein-coding gene expression, developing effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers remains a priority to guide disease management and improve patient outcome. Recent reports of previously-unannotated microRNAs (miRNAs) from multiple somatic tissues have raised the possibility of HNSCC-specific miRNAs. In this study, we applied a customized in-silico analysis pipeline to identify novel miRNAs from raw small-RNA sequencing datasets from public repositories. We discovered 146 previously-unannotated sequences expressed in head and neck samples that share structural properties highly characteristic of miRNAs. The combined expression of the novel miRNAs revealed tissue and context-specific patterns. Furthermore, comparison of tumor with non-malignant tissue samples (n = 43 pairs) revealed 135 of these miRNAs as differentially expressed, most of which were overexpressed or exclusively found in tumor samples. Additionally, a subset of novel miRNAs was significantly associated with HPV infection status and patient outcome. A prognostic-model combining novel and known miRNA was developed (multivariate Cox regression analysis) leading to an improved death and relapse risk stratification (log rank p {\textless} 1e-7). The presence of these miRNAs was corroborated both in an independent dataset and by RT-qPCR analysis, supporting their potential involvement in HNSCC. In this study, we report the discovery of 146 novel miRNAs in head and neck tissues and demonstrate their potential biological significance and clinical relevance to head and neck cancer, providing a new resource for the study of HNSCC.},

The aim of this research is to explore the metastasis associated negative effect of chronic stress. The analysis of transcriptome sequencing implied that activation of STAT3 signaling pathway by downregulated miR-337-3p might be a potential mechanism to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cell and promote metastasis under chronic stress. We also verified this biological process in further experiments. Downregulation of miR-337-3p could downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate vimentin expression in vitro and in vivo. STAT3, related signal pathways of which are involved in metastasis regulation, was directly targeted by miR-337-3p. In conclusion, the above results denoted that activation of miR-337-3p/STAT3 axis might be a potential pathway for the increasing metastasis of breast cancer under chronic stress.},

abstract = {A retrospective review was carried out of the records of 268 patients with a pathologically proved diagnosis of squamous carcinoma of the tongue treated by glossectomy at M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute from January 1, 1970 through December 31, 1979. Pathologic findings found on frozen section analysis were correlated with the TNM stage of the tumor, histologic characteristics, perineural invasion, type of treatment, local recurrence, and survival rate. Thirty-eight patients with squamous carcinoma of the oral tongue and 16 patients with tumors of the base of the tongue had initially positive frozen section margins. Forty-one of these patients had margins that were negative at the completion of surgery. Thirteen patients never had negative margins. Positive mucosal margins were more common in smaller tumors and positive muscular margins were more common in larger tumors. Patients with perineural invasion and larger tumors had a higher percentage of positive margins. Those patients with initially positive margins that were rendered negative at the completion of the procedure and treated with surgery only had a significantly increased local recurrence rate and reduced survival compared with patients similarly treated with initially negative margins. Tumor stage, location (muscular versus mucosal) of positive margins, and the presence of perineural invasion were not significant in predicting local recurrence or decreased survival. If all patients with microscopically positive margins are considered for postoperative radiotherapy, then the routine use of intraoperative frozen section examination of the margins of resection in squamous carcinoma of the tongue may not be justified. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Conclusion:
The presence of positive frozen section margins 
for tumor may be indicative of poor surgical judgment at the time of resection, but more importantly, 
it may also be a subtle means of identifying the more 
aggressive biologic behavior in which the tumor extends microscopically through the muscle bundles 
and in the submucosal lymphatics and the perineural spaces. (perineural invasion, PNI)


Patients with perineural invasion and larger tumors had a higher percentage of positive margins.

Methods Two hundred forty-five patients with buccal cancer who underwent curative treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Results The 5-year overall survival rate was 30.0{\%} before 2002 and 53.5{\%} after 2002 (p =.004). On multivariate analysis, T classification, surgical margins, and treatment modality significantly affected overall survival, and N classification and histologic grade had trends to affect it. Invasion depth had a trend to influence locoregional control. For patients with early-stage disease without adverse factors, the locoregional control was similar between surgery alone group and surgery + radiotherapy group. Conclusion The survival of patients with buccal cancer was improved after 2002, which represented the start of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in our institute. Ipsilateral neck alone irradiation was recommended for T1-2N0-1 and small T3N0 disease, and bilateral neck irradiation could be reserved for advanced disease. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

However, a significant percentage of low-stage squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity will develop local recurrence and disease-related mortality. In this study, we stratified 64 patients with low-stage of oral tongue and floor of mouth patients into high-, intermediate- and low-risk categories based on existing histologic risk model. The classification of these risk categories was based on presence or absence of perineural invasion and evaluation of tumor-host junction for worst pattern of invasion and lymphocytic host response. We correlated risk category and other variables with recurrence and death. In a univariate model, high-risk category tumors had a significantly higher rate of recurrence and death due to recurrence compared with low/intermediate-risk categories (P=0.000 and P=0.047, respectively). Controlling for margin status and T-stage, high-risk category had a 12.4 odds ratio of later recurrence when compared with low/intermediate-risk categories, with a P-value of 0.001. In conclusion, we found low-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma patients with high-risk category have a significantly higher risk for recurrence when compared with patients in the low- or intermediate-risk category, even when controlling for margin status and T-stage. These patients may be suitable candidates for adjuvant treatment to decrease morbidity and mortality associated with a recurrence.

abstract = {The influence of psychosocial factors on the development and progression of cancer has been a longstanding hypothesis since ancient times. In fact, epidemiological and clinical studies over the past 30 years have provided strong evidence for links between chronic stress, depression and social isolation and cancer progression. By contrast, there is only limited evidence for the role of these behavioral factors in cancer initiation. Recent cellular and molecular studies have identified specific signaling pathways that impact cancer growth and metastasis. This article provides an overview of the relationship between psychosocial factors, specifically chronic stress, and cancer progression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE Although the literature suggests that a positive tumour margin on permanent section portends a poor oncologic outcome, the prognostic implication of microscopic tumour cut-through (ie, positive tumour margin on intraoperative frozen section) that is surgically revised to a negative final margin on permanent section is currently unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the influence of microscopic tumour cut-through on disease recurrence and survival and to establish clinicopathologic variables associated with tumour cut-through. DESIGN A retrospective chart review. SETTING The Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto. METHODS Comprehensive clinicopathologic data were collected, including demography, clinical tumour staging (TNM), treatment, histopathologic details, recurrence, management, and follow-up. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Local cancer control and disease-specific survival were the main outcome measures of interest. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess outcome measures by patient group, and the log-rank test was used to compare survival curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to test the association of various clinical factors and to identify independent prognostic factors of local control and disease-specific survival. RESULTS Sixty-five patients met inclusion criteria for our study (37 males; median age 64.4 years). Both local control and disease-specific survival were statistically significantly reduced in patients with positive intraoperative frozen section despite revision to obtain negative margins (p {\textless} .05). Multivariate analysis showed that microscopic tumour cut-through independently predicted poorer local control and disease-specific survival (p {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS This study in patients receiving primary surgery for oral squamous cell carcinoma shows that microscopic tumour cut-through on intraoperative frozen section independently portends a poorer oncologic prognosis, regardless of ultimate tumour margin pathology.},
annote = {retrospective study

Guillemaud and colleagues conducted a retrospective chart review of 65 patients and found that both local control and disease-specific survival were significantly reduced in patients who had initial positive frozen sections despite revision to negative. 

In situations where an intraoperative positive margin is 
obtained, even if the margins are revised to negative by the 
completion of the surgery, additional therapy should be 
considered based on the propensity for local recurrence 
and decreased overall survival of these patients, as 
demonstrated in the present study

They also found that microscopic tumor cut-through on intraoperative frozen sections independently predicted poorer local control and disease-specific survival, suggesting that positive intraoperative margins simply represent more biologically aggressive disease.$\backslash$cite{\{}Scholl1986{\}}

“some authors contend that 
frozen section is unlikely to impact oncologic outcome 
because microscopically involved surgical margins 
(tumour cut-through) on permanent section typically 
reflect aggressive tumour biology rather than surgical error

radiotherapy in such cases is unlikely to improve survival.”3

In the setting of 
involvement of the surgical margin(s) with carcinoma 
documented by frozen section analysis, a further 10 mm 
tissue cuff resection adjacent to the involved margin at the 
primary site was performed and processed for permanent 
histologic assessment. 

Results: see table 2 3 4
This study has also shown that in this group of patients with 
microscopic cut-through at the time of surgery, there is a 
significantly higher proportion of moderate and poorly 
differentiated histopathology diagnoses compared with 
those patients with initial negative frozen biopsies.

@misc{Alsahafi2019,
abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are an aggressive, genetically complex and difficult to treat group of cancers. In lieu of truly effective targeted therapies, surgery and radiotherapy represent the primary treatment options for most patients. But these treatments are associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. Resistance to both radiotherapy and the only available targeted therapy, and subsequent relapse are common. Research has therefore focussed on identifying biomarkers to stratify patients into clinically meaningful groups and to develop more effective targeted therapies. However, as we are now discovering, the poor response to therapy and aggressive nature of HNSCCs is not only affected by the complex alterations in intracellular signalling pathways but is also heavily influenced by the behaviour of the extracellular microenvironment. The HNSCC tumour landscape is an environment permissive of these tumours' aggressive nature, fostered by the actions of the immune system, the response to tumour hypoxia and the influence of the microbiome. Solving these challenges now rests on expanding our knowledge of these areas, in parallel with a greater understanding of the molecular biology of HNSCC subtypes. This update aims to build on our earlier 2014 review by bringing up to date our understanding of the molecular biology of HNSCCs and provide insights into areas of ongoing research and perspectives for the future.},

@article{Rogers1979,
abstract = {(In writing this paper I have drawn heavily on two previous articles of mine, separated by a number of years; Rogers (1963, 1978)). I wish to point to two related tendencies which have acquired more and more importance in my thinking as the years have gone by. One of these is an actualising tendency, a characteristic of organic life. One is a formative tendency in the universe as a whole. Taken together they are, I believe, the foundation blocks of the person-centered approach. Its Characteristics But what do I mean by a person-centered approach? For me it expresses the primary theme of my whole professional life, as that theme has become clarified through experience, interaction with others, and research. I smile as I think of the various labels I have given to this theme during the course of my career -nondirective counselling, client-centered therapy, student-centered teaching, group-centered leadership. As the fields of application have grown in number and variety, the label "person-centered approach" seems the most descriptive. The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. (See Rogers, 1959, for a complete statement.) It is that the individual has within him or herself vast resources for self-understanding, for altering the self-concept basic attitudes, and his or her self-directed behaviour -and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.},
annote = {When I am at my best, as a group facilitator or a therapist, I discover another characteristic. I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then whatever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful. There is nothing I can do to force this experience, but when I can relax and be close to the transcendental core of me, then I may behave in strange and impulsive ways in the relationship, ways which I cannot justify rationally, which have nothing to do with my thought processes. But these strange behaviours turn out to be right, in some odd way. At those moments it seems that my inner spirit has reached out and touched the inner spirit of the other. Our relationship transcends itself, and has become a part of something larger. Profound growth and healing and energy are present.

abstract = {One of the largest factors affecting disease recurrence after surgical cancer resection is negative surgical margins. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an optical imaging technique with potential to serve as a computer aided diagnostic tool for identifying cancer in gross ex-vivo specimens. We developed a tissue classifier using three distinct convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures on HSI data to investigate the ability to classify the cancer margins from ex-vivo human surgical specimens, collected from 20 patients undergoing surgical cancer resection as a preliminary validation group. A new approach for generating the HSI ground truth using a registered histological cancer margin is applied in order to create a validation dataset. The CNN-based method classifies the tumor-normal margin of squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa) versus normal oral tissue with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 for inter-patient validation, performing with 81{\%} accuracy, 84{\%} sensitivity, and 77{\%} specificity. Thyroid carcinoma cancer-normal margins are classified with an AUC of 0.94 for inter-patient validation, performing with 90{\%} accuracy, 91{\%} sensitivity, and 88{\%} specificity. Our preliminary results on a limited patient dataset demonstrate the predictive ability of HSI-based cancer margin detection, which warrants further investigation with more patient data and additional processing techniques to optimize the proposed deep learning method.},

We found no association between bisphosphonate treatment and risk of stroke, after adjusting for large number of clinical and demographic confounders. INTRODUCTION: There is conflicting evidence on the link between bisphosphonates and stroke with studies variously showing increased, decreased or unchanged risk. We investigated the association between bisphosphonate treatment and the risk of stroke using a large routine clinical dataset. METHODS: We used a matched nested case-control study design analysing routinely collected electronic data from patients registered at primary care practices in England participating in the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre. Cases were patients aged 18 years or over, either living or dead, recorded as having had a stroke in the period 1 January 2005 to 31 March 2016. Each case was matched to one control according to age, sex, general practice attended and calendar time. Data were analysed using Stata, version 14.2. and RStudio, version 1.1.463. Conditional logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios for stroke according to bisphosphonate treatment and duration in cases compared with controls. We adjusted for disease risk groups, cardiovascular risk factors, treatments, smoking status, alcohol consumption, ethnicity, bisphosphonate types, fracture and socioeconomic status using IMD (Index of Multiple Deprivation). RESULTS: We included 31,414 cases of stroke with an equal number of matched controls. Overall, 83.2{\%} of cases and controls were aged 65 years or older, and there were similar proportions of females (51.5{\%}) and males (48.5{\%}). Bisphosphonate treatment was not associated with stroke after adjusting for the wide range of confounders considered (OR 0.86, 95{\%} CI 0.62-1.19). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between bisphosphonate treatment and risk of stroke, after adjusting for other confounders.},

Self-compassion entails treating oneself with kindness, recognizing one's shared humanity, and being mindful when considering negative aspects of oneself. Study 1 (N=2,187) compared self-compassion and global self-esteem as they relate to ego-focused reactivity. It was found that self-compassion predicted more stable feelings of self-worth than self-esteem and was less contingent on particular outcomes. Self-compassion also had a stronger negative association with social comparison, public self-consciousness, self-rumination, anger, and need for cognitive closure. Self-esteem (but not self-compassion) was positively associated with narcissism. Study 2 (N=165) compared global self-esteem and self-compassion with regard to positive mood states. It was found that the two constructs were statistically equivalent predictors of happiness, optimism, and positive affect. Results from these two studies suggest that self-compassion may be a useful alternative to global self-esteem when considering what constitutes a healthy self-stance. {\textcopyright} 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In this review, the literature on multiple primaries is reviewed and summarised. Overall, the frequency of multiple primaries is reported in the range of 2-17{\%}. Aetiological factors that may predispose patients to multiple primaries can be grouped into host related, lifestyle factors and environmental influences. Some of the most common cancer predisposition syndromes based on a clinical presentation are discussed and the relevant genetic evaluation and testing are characterised. Importantly, from a clinical standpoint, clinical situations when multiple primaries should be suspected and ruled out in a patient are discussed. Furthermore, general principles and possible treatment strategies for patients with synchronous and metachronous multiple primary tumours are highlighted.},

abstract = {Thymosin beta 4 (T$\beta$4), a pleiotropic actin-sequestering polypeptide that is involved in wound healing and developmental processes, has been reported to be strongly associated with tumorigenesis. A recent tissue microarray analysis showed that T$\beta$4 was highly expressed in certain tumor cells, including lung cancer. However, the exact expression pattern and the role of T$\beta$4 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not to our knowledge been investigated. In the present study, we confirmed that T$\beta$4 expression was increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. T$\beta$4 gene silencing in A549 and H1299 cells inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic investigations revealed a significant decrease in Notch1 activation in T$\beta$4 gene-silenced cells. Moreover, restoring the Notch1 expression attenuated the function of T$\beta$4 silencing in NSCLC cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that T$\beta$4 may play an oncogenic role in NSCLC progression and may be a novel molecular target for anti-NSCLC therapy.},

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with pain regulation and with the generation, maintenance and manipulation of cognitive representations, consistent with its role in expectation. In a heat-pain paradigm, we employed non-invasive low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to transiently disrupt left and right DLPFC function or used the TMS device itself as a placebo, before applying an expectation-induced placebo analgesia. The results demonstrated that placebo significantly increased pain threshold and pain tolerance. While rTMS did not affect pain experience, it completely blocked placebo analgesia. These findings suggest that expectation-induced placebo analgesia is mediated by symmetric prefrontal cortex function.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE The prevalence of early-stage non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is expected to increase with recent implementation of annual screening programs. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed to identify patients at a high risk for recurrence to guide adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE To develop a robust, individualized immune signature that can estimate prognosis in patients with early-stage nonsquamous NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective study analyzed the gene expression profiles of frozen tumor tissue samples from 19 public NSCLC cohorts, including 18 microarray data sets and 1 RNA-Seq data set for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma cohort. Only patients with nonsquamous NSCLC with clinical annotation were included. Samples were from 2414 patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, divided into a meta-training cohort (729 patients), meta-testing cohort (716 patients), and 3 independent validation cohorts (439, 323, and 207 patients). All patients underwent surgery with a negative surgical margin, received no adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, and had publicly available gene expression data and survival information. Data were collected from July 22 through September 8, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overall survival. RESULTS Of 2414 patients (1205 men [50{\%}], 1111 women [46{\%}], and 98 of unknown sex [4{\%}]; median age [range], 64 [15-90] years), a prognostic immune signature of 25 gene pairs consisting of 40 unique genes was constructed using the meta-training data set. In the meta-testing and validation cohorts, the immune signature significantly stratified patients into high-vs low-risk groups in terms of overall survival across and within subpopulations with stage I, IA, IB, or II disease and remained as an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analyses (hazard ratio range, 1.72 [95{\%} CI, 1.26-2.33; P {\textless} .001] to 2.36 [95{\%} CI, 1.47-3.79; P {\textless} .001]) after adjusting for clinical and pathologic factors. Several biological processes, including chemotaxis, were enriched among genes in the immune signature. The percentage of neutrophil infiltration (5.6{\%} vs 1.8{\%}) and necrosis (4.6{\%} vs 1.5{\%}) was significantly higher in the high-risk immune group compared with the low-risk groups in TCGA data set (P {\textless} .003). The immune signature achieved a higher accuracy (mean concordance index [C-index], 0.64) than 2 commercialized multigene signatures (mean C-index, 0.53 and 0.61) for estimation of survival in comparable validation cohorts. When integrated with clinical characteristics such as age and stage, the composite clinical and immune signature showed improved prognostic accuracy in all validation data sets relative to molecular signatures alone (mean C-index, 0.70 vs 0.63) and another commercialized clinical-molecular signature (mean C-index, 0.68 vs 0.65). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The proposed clinical-immune signature is a promising biomarker for estimating overall survival in nonsquamous NSCLC, including early-stage disease. Prospective studies are needed to test the clinical utility of the biomarker in individualized management of nonsquamous NSCLC.},

METHODS: One hundred twenty-three patients with T4a oral cavity SCCs underwent surgical treatment. The volumes of the primary cancer were calculated by the multiplication of 3 macroscopic dimensions of the surgical specimen and related to recurrence and death. RESULTS: There were 54 recurrences (43.9{\%}) and 75 deaths (60.9{\%}). The mean tumor volume among the patients living without disease during the follow-up period was 28.2 cc, compared to 88.2 cc for patients living with disease, and to 78.9 cc for patients who died of the disease (p {\textless} .001). Multivariate analyses showed that volume and perineural invasion were independent factors for recurrence, whereas volume and lymph node metastasis were independent factors for death. CONCLUSION: Among patients who already have advanced cancers, tumor volume can significantly impact their prognoses. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2017.},

An important source of information for virtual validation is the high number of available cancer datasets. Nevertheless, assessing the prognostic performance of a gene expression signature along datasets is a difficult task for Biologists and Physicians and also time-consuming for Statisticians and Bioinformaticians. Therefore, to facilitate performance comparisons and validations of survival biomarkers for cancer outcomes, we developed SurvExpress, a cancer-wide gene expression database with clinical outcomes and a web-based tool that provides survival analysis and risk assessment of cancer datasets. The main input of SurvExpress is only the biomarker gene list. We generated a cancer database collecting more than 20,000 samples and 130 datasets with censored clinical information covering tumors over 20 tissues. We implemented a web interface to perform biomarker validation and comparisons in this database, where a multivariate survival analysis can be accomplished in about one minute. We show the utility and simplicity of SurvExpress in two biomarker applications for breast and lung cancer. Compared to other tools, SurvExpress is the largest, most versatile, and quickest free tool available. SurvExpress web can be accessed in http://bioinformatica.mty.itesm.mx/SurvExpress (a tutorial is included). The website was implemented in JSP, JavaScript, MySQL, and R.},

abstract = {We are moving into the age of 'Big Data' in biomedical research and bioinformatics. This trend could be encapsulated in this simple formula: D = S * F, where the volume of data generated (D) increases in both dimensions: the number of samples (S) and the number of sample features (F). Frequently, a typical omics classification includes redundant and irrelevant features (e.g. genes or proteins) that can result in long computation times; decrease of the model performance and the selection of suboptimal features (genes and proteins) after the classification/regression step. Multiple algorithms and reviews has been published to describe all the existing methods for feature selection, their strengths and weakness. However, the selection of the correct FS algorithm and strategy constitutes an enormous challenge. Despite the number and diversity of algorithms available, the proper choice of an approach for facing a specific problem often falls in a 'grey zone'. In this study, we select a subset of FS methods to develop an efficient workflow and an R package for bioinformatics machine learning problems. We cover relevant issues concerning FS, ranging from domain's problems to algorithm solutions and computational tools. Finally, we use seven different proteomics and gene expression datasets to evaluate the workflow and guide the FS process.},

In recent years an increasing number of data has been published suggesting T$\beta$4's involvement in tumorigenesis. However, T$\beta$4's role in melanoma tumor development still remains to be elucidated. In our study we demonstrate that T$\beta$4 is crucial for melanoma adhesion and invasion. For the purpose of our research we tested melanoma cell lines differing in invasive potential. Moreover, we applied shRNAs to silence TMSB4X (gene encoding T$\beta$4) expression in a cell line with high TMSB4X expression. We found out that T$\beta$4 is not only a component of focal adhesions (FAs) and interacts with several FAs components but also regulates FAs formation. We demonstrate that T$\beta$4 level has an impact on FAs' number and morphology. Moreover, manipulation with TMSB4X expression resulted in changes in cells' motility on non-coated and MatrigelTM (resembling basement membrane composition)-coated surfaces and drastically decreased invasion abilities of the cells. Additionally, a correlation between T$\beta$4 expression level and exhibition of mesenchymal-like [epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)] features was discovered. Cells with lowered TMSB4X expression were less EMT-progressed than control cells. Summarizing, obtained results show that T$\beta$4 by regulating melanoma cells' adhesion has an impact on motility features and EMT. Our study not only contributes to a better understanding of the processes underlying melanoma cells' capacity to create metastases but also highlights T$\beta$4 as a potential target for melanoma management therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) present a typical biochemical  profile of biomarkers: low concentration of beta amyloid 1-42 (Abeta1-42), high concentration of total Tau (t-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau at threonine 181 (p-Tau). Several neurodegenerative diseases may overlap with AD, both in regards to clinical symptoms and neuropathology. Many data suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology can be identified using biomarkers. It has been hypothesized that subjects with dementia due to AD showed low levels of Abeta1-42 combined with the highest levels of total Tau and phosphorylated Tau; moreover, it has been hypothesized that the ratio Abeta1-42:p-Tau further help in discriminating Alzheimer's disease from other diagnoses. The aim of this work is to verify this hypothesis in our cohort of patients and to investigate if the same ratio could be a sensitive index able to discriminate MCI due to neurodegenerative factors (MCId) from MCI due to vascular factors (MCIv). METHODS: Two hundred sixty-two patients meeting the NIA-AA and NINDS-AIREN criteria were diagnosed as follow: AD in 120 patients [mean age 71.6 (42 - 87)], FTD in 23 patients [mean age 67.3 (46 - 78)], LBD in 17 patients [mean age 73.2 (58 - 83)], VAD in 9 patients [mean age 71.2 (60 - 81)]. According to the criteria proposed by Petersen RC, 24 patients had the diagnosis of MCId [mean age 71.8 (59 - 81)], 38 MCIv [mean age 69.3 (55-82). The comparison between the ratio of Abeta1-42/p-Tau among the six groups was done using t-test for independent samples. A p-value {\textless} 0.05 was considered to represent statistical significance. The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve analysis was made using R-studio software. RESULTS: The ratio Abeta1-42:p-Tau was significantly lower in AD and MCId with respect to all the other groups and the difference was also statistically significant between MCId and MCIv. CONCLUSIONS: Abeta1-42:p-Tau ratio has potential for being implemented in the clinical routine for differential diagnosis between AD and other dementias and to distinguish underling pathology such as neurodegenerative or vascular disease.},

Experimental data have been generated on a huge number of organisms, tissue types, treatment conditions and disease states. The Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2005), developed by the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI) at the National Institutes of Health is a repository of nearly 140 000 gene expression experiments. The BioConductor project (Gentleman et al., 2004) is an open-source and open-development software project built in the R statistical programming environment (R Development core Team, 2005) for the analysis and comprehension of genomic data. The tools contained in the BioConductor project represent many state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of microarray and genomics data. We have developed a software tool that allows access to the wealth of information within GEO directly from BioConductor, eliminating many the formatting and parsing problems that have made such analyses labor-intensive in the past. The software, called GEOquery, effectively establishes a bridge between GEO and BioConductor. Easy access to GEO data from BioConductor will likely lead to new analyses of GEO data using novel and rigorous statistical and bioinformatic tools.

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are caused by tobacco and alcohol consumption and by infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV). Tumours often develop within preneoplastic fields of genetically altered cells. The persistence of these fields after treatment presents a major challenge, because it might lead to local recurrences and second primary tumours that are responsible for a large proportion of deaths. Aberrant signalling pathways have been identified in HNSCCs and inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has proved a successful therapeutic strategy. In this Review, we discuss the recent literature on tumour heterogeneity, field cancerization, molecular pathogenesis and the underlying causative cancer genes that can be exploited for novel and personalized treatments of patients with HNSCC.},

abstract = {Background Rapid proliferation and glucose metabolism remodeling are hallmarks of cancers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are potentially involved in Warburg effect. We aimed to identify oncogenic lncRNAs that significantly affect the development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and investigate the metabolism-related mechanisms.Methods Bioinformatics analysis and siRNA library screening were used to pinpoint lncRNAs that significantly affected cell glycolysis and proliferation. RNAScope(R) in situ hybridization and qRT-PCR assays were performed in clinical samples to investigate expression levels and clinical relevance of the lncRNA. RNA interference and CRISPR-Cas9 were used to explore the functional roles of the lncRNA. In vivo, cell-based and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used. Extracellular acidification rate and 13C-labeled intracellular metabolites were determined. RNA pull-down, MS2-Tagged RNA affinity purification, RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation and cross-linking immunoprecipitation were performed to identify lncRNA associated proteins and related mechanisms.Results The lncRNA LOC148709 was identified as a metabolism-related lncRNA. Increased expression of LOC148709 was observed in ESCC and was correlated with poor prognosis. LOC148709 knockdown significantly decreased cell proliferation and glycolysis. Mechanistically, LOC148709 was directly associated with PFKFB3 and significantly affected PFKFB3 stability. LOC148709 interacted mainly with the C-terminal fragment of PFKFB3 and the T5 (2031–2321) fragment of LOC148709 mediated the interaction with PFKFB3. Through inhibiting K302 ubiquitination, LOC148709 protected PFKFB3 from proteasomal degradation, which subsequently activated glycolytic flux and promoted cell cycle progression by regulating p27 and CDK1. P53 could bind to the LOC148709 promoter and repress its transcription, p53 loss or mutation triggered striking LOC148709 upregulation. Multiple micro-environmental factors, including hypoxia and oncogenic stress, were also involved in the LOC148709 regulatory network via affecting the status of p53. Notably, our patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model studies demonstrated that LOC148709 knockdown dramatically impaired tumor growth.Conclusions The lncRNA LOC148709 plays an essential role in glycolytic reprogramming by binding to and stabilizing PFKFB3. This study identified a novel metabolism-related lncRNA and revealed a novel mechanism underlying lncRNA-mediated cancer metabolism remodeling. Translational studies further implicated that LOC148709 is a promising biomarker for cancer diagnosis and therapy.},

abstract = {[We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.]},

abstract = {Thymosin beta-4 (T$\beta$4), actin-sequestering protein, plays important roles in many cellular functions including cancer cell migrations. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) in Wnt signaling pathway is a key molecule to control intercellular interaction. Here, we investigated whether GSK-3 activity is regulated by T$\beta$4 and it is associated with T$\beta$4-mediated migration in gastric cancer cells. Various expression level of T$\beta$4 was observed in human gastric tumor tissues. Migration in gastric cancer cells, SNU638 and SNU668, was dependent on a relative expression level of T$\beta$4. Cell migration was higher in SNU668 with a higher expression level of T$\beta$4 than that in SNU638 with a lower T$\beta$4. Although the level of phosphorylated(p)-GSK-3$\alpha$ (inactive), $\beta$-catenin, E-cadherin and E-cadherin:$\beta$-catenin complex was relatively higher, p-GSK-3$\beta$ (inactive) was lower in SNU638 compared to those in SNU668 cells. LiCl, GSK-3$\alpha$/$\beta$ inhibitor, reduced lung metastasis of B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and SNU668 cell migration. Small interference (si)RNA of GSK-3$\alpha$ increased SNU638 cell migration in accordance with the reduction of E-cadherin:$\beta$-catenin complex formation through a decrease in $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin. Expression level of GSK-3$\alpha$/$\beta$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin in SNU668 and SNU638 was reversed by T$\beta$4-siRNA and by the treatment with acetylated-serine-aspartic acid-lysine-proline (SDKP) tetrapeptide of T$\beta$4, respectively. E-cadherin expression in SNU638 cells was decreased by $\beta$-catenin-siRNA. PD98059, MEK inhibitor, or U0126, ERK inhibitor, reduced SNU668 cell migration accompanying an increase in p-GSK-3$\alpha$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin. Taken together, data indicated that the expression of GSK-3$\alpha$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin could be negatively regulated by T$\beta$4-induced ERK phosphorylation. It suggests that T$\beta$4 could be a novel regulator to control Wnt signaling pathways.},

Querying this database through an API client from an arbitrary programming environment is an essential task, allowing other developers and researchers to focus on their analysis and avoid data wrangling. Hence, as a first result, we developed a workflow to automatically generate, test and deploy such clients for rapid response to API changes. Its underlying infrastructure, a combination of free and publicly available web services, facilitates the development of API clients. It decouples changes in server software from the client software by reacting to changes in the RESTful service and removing direct dependencies on a specific implementation of an API. As a second result, FirebrowseR, an R client to the Broad Institute's RESTful Firehose Pipeline, is provided as a working example, which is built by the means of the presented workflow.

abstract = {Objectives: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most common oral cancer with a poor prognosis owing to limited understanding of the disease mechanisms. The aim of this study was to explore and identify the potential biomarkers in OSCC by integrated bioinformatics analysis.Materials and Methods: Expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and differentially expressed RNAs (DERNAs) were subsequently identified in OSCC by bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to analyze DERNAs. Then, the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was constructed in Cytoscape and the protein -protein interaction (PPI) network was established in the STRING database. We established a risk model to predict the overall survival of OSCC on the basis of DElncRNAs with Kaplan–Meier analysis and combined with logrank p test. Furthermore, we identified potential biomarkers by combining univariate Cox regression with overall survival rate, which were then validated in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), OSCC cell lines and OSCC specimens.Results: A total of 1,919 DEmRNAs, 286 DElncRNAs and 111 DEmiRNAs were found to be dysregulated in OSCC. A ceRNA network included 46 DElncRNAs,7 DEmiRNAs and 10 DEmRNAs, and the PPI network included 712 DEmRNAs including 31 hub genes. Moreover, a 7 lncRNAs risk model was established and four genes (CMA1, GNA14, HCG22, HOTTIP) were identified as biomarkers on overall survival in patients with OSCC.Conclusions: This study successfully constructed a ceRNA network and a PPI network which play a crucial role in OSCC. A risk model was established to predict the prognosis, and four DERNAs are revealed with overall survival in patients with OSCC, suggesting that they may be potential biomarkers in tumor diagnosis and treatment.},

Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.},

Here, we have built and validated multivariable models that integrate gene signatures with clinical and pathological variables to improve staging and survival prediction of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Gene expression profiles from 249 human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative OSCCs were explored to identify a 22-gene lymph node metastasis signature (LNMsig) and a 40- gene overall survival signature (OSsig). To facilitate future clinical implementation and increase performance, these signatures were transferred to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays and validated in an independent cohort of 125 HPVnegative tumors. When applied in the clinically relevant subgroup of early-stage (cT1-2N0) OSCC, the LNMsig could prevent overtreatment in two-third of the patients. Additionally, the integration of RT-qPCR gene signatures with clinical and pathological variables provided accurate prognostic models for oral cancer, strongly outperforming TNM. Finally, the OSsig gene signature identified a subpopulation of patients, currently considered at low-risk for disease-related survival, who showed an unexpected poor prognosis. These well-validated models will assist in personalizing primary treatment with respect to neck dissection and adjuvant therapies.},

abstract = {Background. Involvement of resection margins and the pattern of tumor invasion are reported to be important predictors of local recurrence and survival in surgically treated patients. In this study we have retrospectively assessed the significance of these two prognostic factors in a relatively homogeneous patient population. Patients and Methods. This study was confined to 150 previously untreated patients who had surgery for squamous carcinoma of the oral tongue between 1987 and 1993. There were 82 men and 68 women who ranged in age from 25 to 89 years (median 60 years). Glossectomy was peroral in 129, whereas 8 and 13, respectively, had a cheek flap or mandibulotomy approach. Some form of lymphadenectomy was performed in 109 (73{\%}), and 51 patients (34{\%}) received postoperative radiotherapy. Histologic slides from each primary tumor were reviewed to verify the margin status. In addition, the pattern of invasion was evaluated and graded from 1 to 4, varying from a consistently well-defined, 'pushing' border (Grade 1) to diffuse infiltration and cellular dissociation (Grade 4). Results. Intraoperative frozen section assessment of margins was accurate, whether positive or negative, in 118 of 133 patients (89{\%}). Positive or close margins (within one high-power field) and an endophytic growth pattern were associated with a significant increase in local recurrence (p {\textless}0.003 and {\textless}0.04, respectively). With higher grades of infiltration (Grade 3 or 4; 82 patients), the tumors tended to be larger and the patients younger. Although the likelihood of nodal involvement and subsequent distant metastasis was significantly greater in those with Grade 3 or grade 4 patterns (p {\textless}0.0003 and {\textless}0.01, respectively), there was no impact on local recurrence. Cumulative survival was similar whether or not the surgical margins were involved, but was significantly reduced when the pattern of tumor invasion was of higher grade (p {\textless}0.01). Summary. Frozen section provided reasonably accurate information about margins in our patients, whether taken from the patient or the surgical specimen. Positive margins increased the likelihood of local recurrence, but did not impact on survival because subsequent surgery and/or irradiation controlled tumor recurrence in some patients. Grade 3 or 4 patterns at the tumor/host interface were associated with an increased incidence of nodal and distant metastasis, as well as a significant decrease in survival.},

abstract = {The infectious SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, which is now a global pandemic. Aiming for effective treatments, we focused on the key drug target, the viral 3C-like (3CL) protease. We modeled a big dataset with 42 SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease−ligand complex structures from ∼98.7{\%} similar SARS-CoV 3CL protease with abundant complex structures. The diverse flexible active site conformations identified in the dataset were clustered into six protease pharmacophore clusters (PPCs). For the PPCs with distinct flexible protease active sites and diverse interaction environments we identified harmaco hore anchor hots ots A total of 11 “PPC consensus anchors” (a distinct set observed in each PPC) were observed, of which three “PPC core anchors” EHV2, HV1, and V3 are strongly conserved across PPCs. The six PPC cavities were then applied in virtual screening of 2122 FDA drugs for repurposing, using core anchor-derived “PPC scoring S” to yield seven drug candidates. Experimental testing by SARS-CoV-2 3CL protease inhibition assay and antiviral cytopathic effect assays discovered active hits, Boceprevir and Telaprevir (HCV drugs) and Nelfinavir (HIV drug). Specifically, Boceprevir showed strong protease inhibition with micromolar IC50 of 1.42 $\mu$M and an antiviral activity with EC50 of 49.89 $\mu$M, whereas Telaprevir showed moderate protease inhibition only with an IC50 of 11.47 $\mu$M. Nelfinavir solely showed antiviral activity with a micromolar EC50 value of 3.28 $\mu$M. Analysis of binding mechanisms of protease inhibitors revealed the role of PPC core anchors.

abstract = {Objectives: Achieving complete tumour resection is one of the main goals of surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumours. Whether biological characteristics of tumours contribute to the surgical resectability and the presence of positive surgical margins (SM) after resection of HNSCC is unclear. We aimed to address this issue. Materials and methods: We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to relate the SM status of 356 HNSCC tumours covering five major primary locations (tongue, larynx, tonsils, floor of mouth and buccal mucosa) with data from multiple omics approaches (transcriptomic, genomic and proteomic analyses). Results: We identified three differentially expressed genes whose expression was significantly associated with the presence of positive SM in tongue tumours (n = 144). The three genes (CCDC66, ZRANB2 and VCPKMT) displayed significantly higher mRNA levels in tongue tumours with positive SM compared to tumours with negative SM. The corresponding gene expression signature identified tongue tumours with a positive SM with high sensitivity and specificity (85{\%} and 76{\%}, respectively, Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.84). Tongue tumours with this signature were characterised by a high grade, elevated proliferation levels and a tumour stroma with fewer fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Conclusion: Positive SM were found to be strikingly associated with tumour biology in tongue tumours. These findings offer interesting perspectives for biomarker identification and precision surgery in these tumours.},

abstract = {We have developed an evolutionary approach for flexible ligand docking. This approval, GEMDOCK, uses a Generic Evolutionary Method for molecular DOCKing and an empirical scoring function. The former combines both discrete and continuous global search strategies with local search strategies to speed up convergence, whereas the latter results in rapid recognition of potential ligands. GEMDOCK was tested on a diverse data set of 100 protein-ligand complexes from the Protein Data Bank. In 79{\%} of these complexes, the docked lowest energy ligand structures had root-mean-square derivations (RMSDs) below 2.0 {\AA} with respect to the corresponding crystal structures. The success rate increased to 85{\%} if the structure water molecules were retained. We evaluated GEMDOCK on two cross-docking experiments in which each ligand of a protein ensemble was docked into each protein of the ensemble. Seventy-six percent of the docked structures had RMSDs below 2.0 A when the ligands were docked into foreign structures. We analyzed and validated GEMDOCK with respect to various search spaces and scoring functions, and found that if the scoring function was perfect, then the predicted accuracy was also essentially perfect. This study suggests that GEMDOCK is a useful tool for molecular recognition and may be used to systematically evaluate and thus improve scoring functions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

HPV issue....

Author reply:
The author replies: HPV vaccination prevents 90 to 100{\%} of chronic HPV infections with high-risk serotypes such as 16 and 18, which have been implicated in 70{\%} of cervical cancers, 90{\%} of anal cancers, and the majority of oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers.1 The effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination was validated with the use of clinical trial end points of preventing anogenital precursor lesions, such as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ, and vaginal and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, with subsequent real-world decreases in the incidence of precancerous findings and associated cancers.2 Zhuang and Xu emphasize data supporting the hypothesis that HPV vaccination prevents oral HPV-16 infection and will lead to decreases in the incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer. Although I agree with this premise and advocate for vaccination, prospective validated data regarding vaccine efficacy in the prevention of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer are currently lacking. It would be helpful for prophylactic vaccine efficacy trials to adopt decreased incidence of oral HPV-16 infection as a compelling surrogate end point because assessment of precancerous conditions is challenging. Moreover, effects of vaccination will not be reflected in oropharyngeal cancer rates for decades because of a latency of 10 to 30 years from infection to the development of cancer.3
Ch'ng points out the changes in pathologic carcinoma in situ (Tis), T0, and T1 tumor-designation differences for HPV-associated and HPV-negative oropharyngeal carcinomas and the need for clarification of inaccuracies in Tables 1 and 2 of my article. For HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, Tis no longer exists because the histologic distinction between in situ disease and invasion is difficult to assess; therefore, readers should replace Tis tumor staging with T0 or T1. For HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancer, Tis exists and can be assessed, whereas T0 should be removed.4 For further staging details, see the 2017 AJCC–UICC 8th edition guidelines.4
Dauby highlights head and neck cancer as an HIV indicator condition, given the greater risk of head and neck cancer among HIV-infected patients than among noninfected persons. The HIV Indicator Diseases across Europe Study (HIDES) I, which was conducted from 2009 to 2011, supported the cost-effectiveness of routine HIV testing in reducing morbidity and mortality among patients with an HIV indicator condition when the prevalence exceeded 0.1{\%}.5 Despite expansion of the study to include more centers and indicator conditions in HIDES II, which was conducted from 2012 to 2015, head and neck cancer was not included as an indicator condition, and the decreasing incidence of cancer indicator conditions alongside decreases in the incidence of HIV infection led to decreases in prevalence below HIV testing thresholds for a few indicator cancers.5 Early diagnosis of HIV infection decreases morbidity among patients with high-risk indicator conditions; however, continued decreases in the prevalence of HIV infection in North America and Europe merit reevaluation of routine testing.

abstract = {Background: Pharmacological interactions are useful for understanding ligand binding mechanisms of a therapeutic target. These interactions are often inferred from a set of active compounds that were acquired experimentally. Moreover, most docking programs loosely coupled the stages (binding-site and ligand preparations, virtual screening, and post-screening analysis) of structure-based virtual screening (VS). An integrated VS environment, which provides the friendly interface to seamlessly combine these VS stages and to identify the pharmacological interactions directly from screening compounds, is valuable for drug discovery.Results: We developed an easy-to-use graphic environment, iGEMDOCK, integrating VS stages (from preparations to post-screening analysis). For post-screening analysis, iGEMDOCK provides biological insights by deriving the pharmacological interactions from screening compounds without relying on the experimental data of active compounds. The pharmacological interactions represent conserved interacting residues, which often form binding pockets with specific physico-chemical properties, to play the essential functions of a target protein. Our experimental results show that the pharmacological interactions derived by iGEMDOCK are often hot spots involving in the biological functions. In addition, iGEMDOCK provides the visualizations of the protein-compound interaction profiles and the hierarchical clustering dendrogram of the compounds for post-screening analysis.Conclusions: We have developed iGEMDOCK to facilitate steps from preparations of target proteins and ligand libraries toward post-screening analysis. iGEMDOCK is especially useful for post-screening analysis and inferring pharmacological interactions from screening compounds. We believe that iGEMDOCK is useful for understanding the ligand binding mechanisms and discovering lead compounds. iGEMDOCK is available at http://gemdock.life.nctu.edu.tw/dock/igemdock.php. {\textcopyright} 2011 Hsu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {The mechanism and gene markers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), a common malignant tumor, have not yet been identified. The aim of this study was to identify the key genes and pathways associated with HNSCC and to further analyze its molecular mechanism and prognostic significance. In this study, the expression profile chip data GSE6631 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) included paired HNSCC tumor and normal samples from 22 patients; the RNAseq tertiary dataset of HNSCC and corresponding clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) included biological information of 12 normal head and neck tissues and 111 HNSCC sample tissues. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by R software, and the pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs was performed by DAVID, String, and Sytoscape software programs. Combining the GEO and the TCGA databases, we used bioinformatics technology to screen out 50 DEGs in HNSCC and enrich the biological functions and key pathways of HNSCC. Then we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis, and survival analysis on these DEGs. Using CMap, we identified candidate small molecules that might reverse HNSCC gene expression. Finally, four most important small molecules that could provide more reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and individualized control of HNSCC were identified.},

abstract = {Background. The interval between intra-arterial infusion chemotherapy (IAIC) and surgery was investigated in terms of its effects on survival in patients with locally advanced oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Methods. This retrospective study analyzed 126 patients who had completed treatment modalities for stage IV OSCC. All patients were followed up for 3 years. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to determine how survival was affected by general factors, primary tumor volume, TNM stage, and duration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Results. In 126 patients treated for locally advanced OSCC by preoperative induction IAIC using methotrexate, multivariate analysis of relevant prognostic factors showed that an IAIC duration longer than 90 days was significantly associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio, 1.77; P=0.0259 ). Conclusions. Duration of IAIC is a critical factor in the effectiveness of multimodal treatment for locally advanced OSCC. Limiting the induction course to 90 days improves overall survival.},

abstract = {Genomic sequencing projects unraveled the mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and provided a comprehensive catalog of somatic mutations. However, the limited number of significant cancer-related genes obtained so far only partially explains the biological complexity of HNSCC and hampers the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We pursued a multiscale omics approach based on whole-exome sequencing, global DNA methylation and gene expression profiling data derived from tumor samples of the HIPO-HNC cohort (n = 87), and confirmed new findings with datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Promoter methylation was confirmed by MassARRAY analysis and protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining. We discovered a set of cancer-related genes with frequent somatic mutations and high frequency of promoter methylation. This included the ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), which showed variable promoter methylation and expression in both tumor samples and cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections unraveled a gradual loss of RYR2 expression from normal mucosa via dysplastic lesion to invasive cancer and indicated that reduced RYR2 expression in adjacent tissue and precancerous lesions might serve as risk factor for unfavorable prognosis and upcoming malignant conversion. In summary, our data indicate that impaired RYR2 function by either somatic mutation or epigenetic silencing is a common event in HNSCC pathogenesis. Detection of RYR2 expression and/or promoter methylation might enable risk assessment for malignant conversion of dysplastic lesions.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are characterized by a marked propensity for local invasion and dissemination to cervical lymph nodes, with distant metastases developing in 30-40{\%} of cases. Overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/c-erbB-1) and/or its ligands and high levels of certain matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of EGFR ligands on gelatinase expression and invasion in HNSCC cell lines. We tested epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor $\alpha$, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and amphiregulin and measured expression of gelatinases MMP-9 and MMP-2 in an established squamous carcinoma cell line (Detroit-562) and in two cell lines newly derived from patients with head and neck cancers (SIHN-005A and SIHN-006). Incubation of the cell lines with EGF-like ligands up-regulated MMP-9 (but not MMP-2) expression as measured by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR in a dose-dependent manner, with the effects being most marked in cells with high EGFR levels and undetectable in cells with low levels. Maximum stimulation was obtained in a concentration range of 10-100 nM. In addition, we confirmed by zymography that gelatinolytic activity consistent with MMP-9 (M(r) 92,000) was up-regulated in parallel with increases in gene expression. Betacellulin (which binds both to EGFR and c-erbB-4 receptors) consistently increased MMP- 9 expression and activation to a significantly greater degree than the other four ligands when tested at equimolar concentrations. In parallel with MMP-9 up-regulation, all EGF-like ligands increased tumor cell invasion through Matrigel in in vitro Transwell assays. These activities were independent of ligand effects on cell proliferation. Antagonist (ICR62) or agonist (ICR9) anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, respectively, inhibited or potentiated MMP-9 activity and tumor cell invasion induced by all ligands. Furthermore, a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes MMP-9 activity (Ab1) also inhibited ligand-induced invasion of HNSCC. We confirmed that tumor cell lines used in these studies (and a larger series not reported here) generally expressed multiple c-erbB receptors and ligands. These results indicate that autocrine or paracrine signaling through EGFR potentiates the invasive potential of HNSCC via the selective up-regulation and activation of MMP-9. Furthermore, ligands such as betacellulin (which is commonly expressed in HNSCC), which can bind to and activate other c-erbB receptors, may be especially potent in this regard.},

abstract = {A single head and neck Cancer (HNC) is a globally growing challenge associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis itself can affect the patients profoundly let alone the complex and disfiguring treatment. The highly important functions of structures of the head and neck such as mastication, speech, aesthetics, identity and social interactions make a cancer diagnosis in this region even more psychologically traumatic. The emotional distress engendered as a result of functional and social disruption is certain to negatively affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The key biological responses to stressful events are moderated through the combined action of two systems, the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) which releases glucocorticoids and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which releases catecholamines. In acute stress, these hormones help the body to regain homeostasis; however, in chronic stress their increased levels and activation of their receptors may aid in the progression of cancer. Despite ample evidence on the existence of stress in patients diagnosed with HNC, studies looking at the effect of stress on the progression of disease are scarce, compared to other cancers. This review summarises the challenges associated with HNC that make it stressful and describes how stress signalling aids in the progression of cancer. Growing evidence on the relationship between stress and HNC makes it paramount to focus future research towards a better understanding of stress and its effect on head and neck cancer.},

PSM rates were compared between two time periods, 1998-2002 and 2008-2012. PSM was positively correlated with tumor category and grade. Ovarian and prostate cancers had the highest PSM prevalence in women and men, respectively. The highest PSM rates for cancers affecting both genders were seen for oral cavity tumors. PSM rates for breast cancer and lung and bronchus cancer in both men and women declined over the study period. PSM increases were seen for bladder, colon and rectum, and kidney and renal pelvis cancers.

abstract = {Whereas evidence for the role of psychosocial factors in cancer initiation has been equivocal, support continues to grow for links between psychological factors such as stress, depression, and social isolation and progression of cancer. In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies show that stress-related processes can impact pathways implicated in cancer progression, including immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Contributions of systemic factors, such as stress hormones to the crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells, appear to be critical in modulating downstream signaling pathways with important implications for disease progression. Inflammatory pathways may also be implicated in fatigue and other factors related to quality of life. Although substantial evidence supports a positive effect of psychosocial interventions on quality of life in cancer, the clinical evidence for efficacy of stress-modulating psychosocial interventions in slowing cancer progression remains inconclusive, and the biobehavioral mechanisms that might explain such effects are still being established.

@article{Kulkarni2018,
abstract = {Background: Reproducibility of a research is a key element in the modern science and it is mandatory for any industrial application. It represents the ability of replicating an experiment independently by the location and the operator. Therefore, a study can be considered reproducible only if all used data are available and the exploited computational analysis workflow is clearly described. However, today for reproducing a complex bioinformatics analysis, the raw data and the list of tools used in the workflow could be not enough to guarantee the reproducibility of the results obtained. Indeed, different releases of the same tools and/or of the system libraries (exploited by such tools) might lead to sneaky reproducibility issues. Results: To address this challenge, we established the Reproducible Bioinformatics Project (RBP), which is a non-profit and open-source project, whose aim is to provide a schema and an infrastructure, based on docker images and R package, to provide reproducible results in Bioinformatics. One or more Docker images are then defined for a workflow (typically one for each task), while the workflow implementation is handled via R-functions embedded in a package available at github repository. Thus, a bioinformatician participating to the project has firstly to integrate her/his workflow modules into Docker image(s) exploiting an Ubuntu docker image developed ad hoc by RPB to make easier this task. Secondly, the workflow implementation must be realized in R according to an R-skeleton function made available by RPB to guarantee homogeneity and reusability among different RPB functions. Moreover she/he has to provide the R vignette explaining the package functionality together with an example dataset which can be used to improve the user confidence in the workflow utilization. Conclusions: Reproducible Bioinformatics Project provides a general schema and an infrastructure to distribute robust and reproducible workflows. Thus, it guarantees to final users the ability to repeat consistently any analysis independently by the used UNIX-like architecture.},

abstract = {Purpose The surgical margin is the main prognostic factor over which the surgeon has control during resection of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). This study examined the association between surgical excision margins of patients with OSCC and outcomes of disease-free and overall survival. Materials and Methods The authors implemented a retrospective cohort study. The sample was composed of patients with OSCC having resection as their initial treatment. The predictor variable was the pathologic surgical margin, defined as clear ({\textgreater}5 mm), close (1 to 5 mm), or involved ({\textless}1 mm). The outcome variables were disease-free (absence of locoregional recurrence) and overall survival. Data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression hazard model. Results The sample was composed of 54 patients with a mean age of 60.5 years (range, 19 to 85 yr) and 26{\%} were women. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 59 and 50{\%}, respectively. The clear surgical margin group showed higher disease-free survival rates than patients with close and involved margins (5-yr probability, 0.78 vs 0.43 and 0.29; P =.014) and a trend toward increased overall survival at 2 and 5 years (P =.093). Conclusion The results suggest that the presence of a close surgical margin (1 to 5 mm) is an adverse risk feature comparable to an involved margin and therefore is associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival. Future studies are needed to replicate these findings before they can be used as a basis for clinical recommendations.},

abstract = {Oral cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is a common form of head and neck cancer throughout the developed and developing world. However, the etiology of OCSCC is still unclear. Here, we explored the extent to which tobacco use, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection and genetic and transcriptomic changes contributed to the oncogenesis of OCSCC. In a prospective observational study, we analysed fresh tissue biopsies from 45 OCSCC collected from 51 subjects presenting with OCSCC to the Brisbane Head and Neck Clinics between 2013 and 2015. Exploration of the genetic and transcriptomic landscape of the biopsies were performed using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and whole exome sequencing. HPV associated tumours were determined using p16 staining of histological sections and RNA sequencing. Patient demographics including tumor location within the oral cavity, and history of tobacco and alcohol use were correlated with genomic and transcriptomics analyses. About 4.5{\%} of OCSCC were HPV associated. The most frequent mutations in the OCSCC samples were in the TP53 and CDKN2A genes, but no association of specific mutations with HPV or tobacco use was observed. Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis to explore the RNA-seq data, tumors from participants with a history of tobacco use showed a significant trend towards increased mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) signaling and decreased mitochondrial respiration. In conclusion, HPV was shown to be an uncommon association with OCSCC and changes in TP53 transcriptional regulation, mTOR signaling and mitochondrial function were associated with a history of tobacco use. Larger data sets will be required to enable detection of differences which may help with development of personalized therapeutics in the future.},

The 3-(3,4-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that H-1R had a 10-fold greater resistance to CDDP than H-1. When we compared gene expression levels in the cell lines using an in-house cDNA microarray, which represented 2,201 genes originating from normal oral tissue, primary oral cancer, and oral cancer cell lines, 12 genes showing elevated mRNA expression in H-1R compared with H-1 were identified. Among them, the up-regulated expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (MDR1, MRP1, and MRP2), CD55, and PGK1 and down-regulated expression of Caveolin 1 were further confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR. Our results suggest that H-1 and H-1R cell lines could be useful for elucidating the candidate genes responsible for CDDP resistance, including the genes found in this study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (outside the USA). Purpose: An examination of multiple primary cancers can provide insight into the etiologic role of genes, the environment, and prior cancer treatment on a cancer patient's risk of developing a subsequent cancer. Different rules for registering multiple primary cancers (MP) are used by cancer registries throughout the world making data comparisons difficult. Methods: We evaluated the effect of SEER and IARC/IACR rules on cancer incidence rates and trends using data from the SEER Program. We estimated age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and trends (1975–2011) for the top 26 cancer categories using joinpoint regression analysis. Results: ASIRs were higher using SEER compared to IARC/IACR rules for all cancers combined (3 {\%}) and, in rank order, melanoma (9 {\%}), female breast (7 {\%}), urinary bladder (6 {\%}), colon (4 {\%}), kidney and renal pelvis (4 {\%}), oral cavity and pharynx (3 {\%}), lung and bronchus (2 {\%}), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2 {\%}). ASIR differences were largest for patients aged 65+ years. Trends were similar using both MP rules with the exception of cancers of the urinary bladder, and kidney and renal pelvis. Conclusions: The choice of multiple primary coding rules effects incidence rates and trends. Compared to SEER MP coding rules, IARC/IACR rules are less complex, have not changed over time, and report fewer multiple primary cancers, particularly cancers that occur in paired organs, at the same anatomic site and with the same or related histologic type. Cancer registries collecting incidence data using SEER rules may want to consider including incidence rates and trends using IARC/IACR rules to facilitate international data comparisons.},

abstract = {Owning to advancements in sensor-based, non-destructive phenotyping platforms, researchers are increasingly collecting data with higher temporal resolution. These phenotypes collected over several time points are cataloged as longitudinal traits and used for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Longitudinal GWAS typically yield a large number of output files, posing a significant challenge to data interpretation and visualization. Efficient, dynamic, and integrative data visualization tools are essential for the interpretation of longitudinal GWAS results for biologists; however, these tools are not widely available to the community. We have developed a flexible and user-friendly Shiny-based online application, ShinyAIM, to dynamically view and interpret temporal GWAS results. The main features of the application include (a) interactive Manhattan plots for single time points, (b) a grid plot to view Manhattan plots for all time points simultaneously, (c) dynamic scatter plots for p-value-filtered selected markers to investigate co-localized genomic regions across time points, (d) and interactive phenotypic data visualization to capture variation and trends in phenotypes. The application is written entirely in the R language and can be used with limited programming experience. ShinyAIM is deployed online as a Shiny web server application at https://chikudaisei.shinyapps.io/shinyaim/, enabling easy access for users without installation.

Based on landmark phase III trials, two anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been approved for HNSCC by FDA and EMEA in the recurrent/metastatic setting; in addition, pembrolizumab has recently received FDA and EMEA approval as first line treatment. In clinical practice, only a minority of patients with HNSCC derive benefit from immunotherapy and the need for the discovery of novel biomarkers to optimize treatment strategies is becoming increasingly more relevant. Although currently only PD-L1 is widely used as a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC, there are many ongoing trials focusing on the identification of new biomarkers.

Conclusions 
Immunotherapy is a complex and rapidly evolving field that has the potential to provide substantial clinical benefit to patients with a variety of cancers. However, it becomes increasingly clear that a sig- nificant proportion of patients do not respond to widely used im- munotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, only PD-L1 is a validated biomarker used in clinical practice to guide treatment selection. Research should focus on improvement of patient selection, by implementing PD-L1 and by identifying new predictive biomarkers. In this context, tumor mutational burden, INF-$\gamma$ signature, HPV status and the host's microbiome have emerged as potential pre- dictors of immune response and are currently being evaluated in clin- ical trials. In addition, the tumor microenvironment represents an in- teresting source for the development of novel biomarkers. On the other hand, combination therapies will be required to increase treatment efficacy. Investigating cancer immunology by reverse translating to the laboratory from clinical studies is needed to bring benefit to a greater number of patients. Development of strategies for patients who lack preexisting immunity is also necessary. Such strategies will be able to fulfill the promise that immunotherapy brings to the advancement of oncology. Indeed, we are at the beginning of an exciting journey for patients and for scientific investigation.},

However, the criteria to stratify patients to receive postoperative adjuvant therapy is still clinicopathologic factor-oriented such as differentiation, tumor size, the presence of pleural involvement and vascular invasion and so on. Even using adjuvant treatment under these criteria, 5 - year survival rate is around 60{\%} even in early-stage disease. Here, we extracted potential candidate genes for stratifying resected NSCLC patients according to correlation with their survival using public big data and validated the prognostic role of the extracted candidate gene in tumor samples of patients' cohort with resected NSCLC. Method Using hypothesis “X-negative implies Y-positive.” (X: regulatory gene, Y: prognosis related gene), we extracted (X,Y) gene pairs in TCGA RNA seq expression data of stage I-IIIA resected NSCLC. Then, among extracted (X,Y) gene pairs, we choose only appropriate (X,Y) gene pairs according to their biology during the tumorigenesis process. We validated these extracted gene pairs as prognostic factors in 111 patients with surgically resected NSCLC at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital of the Catholic Medical Center between 2007 and 2011 with immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of each molecule. Results In TCGA database, we found 21 regulatory genes and 38 prognosis-related-gene pairs in lung adenocarcinoma. Among them, VEGFC-ITGA5 pair was suggested to be relevant to tumorigenesis in the previous studies. In tumour tissues of 111 patients of resected NSCLC, the expression of ITGA5 was statistically correlated with that of VEGFC (P = 0.015). In the patients with low expression of ITGA5, disease-free survival was longer than that in those with high expression (79.4 months vs 59.1 months, P = 0.049) Conclusion lITGA5 which affects VEGFC might one of the potential biomarkers relevant prognosis in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.},

This study aimed to investigate potential pathways and genes associated with TP53 mutations in adult de novo AML. Methods An RNA sequencing dataset of adult de novo AML was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by edgeR of the R platform. Key pathways and genes were identified using the following bioinformatics tools: gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), gene ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins, and Molecular Complex Detection. Results GSEA suggested that TP53 mutations were significantly associated with cell differentiation, proliferation, cell adhesion biological processes, and MAPK pathway. In total, 1,287 genes were identified as DEGs. GO and KEGG analysis suggested that upregulation of DEGs was significantly enriched in categories associated with cell adhesion biological processes, Ras-associated protein 1, PI3K-Akt pathway, and cell adhesion molecules. The top ten genes ranked by degree, CDH1, BMP2, KDR, LEP, CASR, ITGA2B, APOE, MNX1, NMU, and TRH, were identified as hub genes from the protein-protein interaction network. Survival analysis suggested that patients with TP53 mutations had a significantly increased risk of death, while the mRNA expression level in patients with TP53 mutation was similar to those carrying TP53 wild type. Conclusion Our findings have indicated that multiple genes and pathways may play a crucial role in TP53 mutation AML, offering candidate targets and strategies for TP53 mutation AML individualized treatment.},

abstract = {Background When it is diagnosed early, gastric cancer (GC) has a good therapeutic response with a high survival rate; however, advanced and metastatic stages of the disease are associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, identification of novel biomarkers for GC is important for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic intervention improvement. This study aimed to identify diagnostic and prognostic marker genes of GC by combining bioinformatics analysis of gene expression/sequence data. Methods A bioinformatics pipeline was established to analyze and select differently expressed genes from public available database GEO and TCGA. Briefly, the following sets of conditions that satisfy the requirements for the potential biomarker candidate genes for GC are proposed: 1. They should be differentially expressed between overall normal tissues and GC tissues (fold change {\textgreater}1.5) in both microarray and RNA-seq results (intersection of differential expressed genes in TCGA and GEO data); 2. The differential expression should be consistent among each microarray data series; and 3. They should keep stable expression of either increased or decreased in all subgroups of TNM stages in all available data. We have successfully applied the procedure for identification of biomarkers for GC. Case-matched normal and tumor tissues and serum samples were examined and validated. Cell proliferation, invasion and connection among candidate genes with major oncogene c-myc were also examined. Results A total of 483 GC tissues and 105 normal tissues were retrieved from public available database GEO and TCGA. 13 candidate genes were selected by our algorithm. Validation in our sample showed that 6 of the 13 candidate genes were expressed at significantly elevated levels in GC tissues compared to normal tissues in 45 pairs of tissues. Furthermore, high-level expressions of SMC4, IGF2BP3 and E2F3 were associated with advanced tumor stage or poor histologic type. Expression of these three genes was validated in serum samples and showed distinguished differences between GC and control patients. A number of functional terms identified that shared among different genes were identified, including cell cycle, positive regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process and cellular biosynthetic process. In addition, cancer-related signaling pathways such as Hedgehog pathway, TGF-beta pathway, NOD-like receptor pathway, antigen processing and presentation and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation were also found among candidate genes. KEGG pathway analysis online showed that E2F3 and BMP6 were both related to cell proliferation, MMP11 had an indirect effect on sustained angiogenesis and was correlated with VEGF signaling pathway, HSP90AA1 regulated androgen receptor and indirectly affected proliferation, and E2F3 functioned in the blocking of differentiation ROC curves were made afterward and the sensitivity and specificity reached the highest level when we combined the three genes together (sensitivity: 83.3{\%}, specificity: 86.7{\%}, AUC: 0.9044). We thus wondered if E2F3 and 2 other identified markers are targeted by c-myc in GC. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis suggested that siRNAs could significantly downregulate c-myc expression. The expression of all the three selected genes was significantly downregulated by after c-myc inhibition, as identified both by qRT-PCR and western blot. Luciferase reporter assay showed that knockdown of c-myc significantly reduced the promoter activity of IGF2BP3 (P=0.000), SMC4 (P=0.000), and E2F3 (P=0.000). Based on the above findings, we define these three genes to classic oncogenes and propose an oncogenic pathway implicated in gastric carcinogenesis. Conclusion Our data suggest E2F3, SMC4 and IGF2BP3 as novel biomarkers to establish the diagnosis and prognosis of GC by liquid biopsy and could be considered a strategy to target these 3 genes as a potential adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer treatment. In the future, a larger and more comprehensive clinical study, as well as molecular mechanistic analyses should be carried out to further dissect the detailed functions of selected genes in GC, which could be identified as useful clinical diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers.},

abstract = {Multi-omics data, that is, datasets containing different types of high-dimensional molecular variables (often in addition to classical clinical variables), are increasingly generated for the investigation of various diseases. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the usefulness of multi-omics data for the prediction of disease outcomes such as survival time. It is also unclear which methods are most appropriate to derive such prediction models. We aim to give some answers to these questions by means of a large-scale benchmark study using real data. Different prediction methods from machine learning and statistics were applied on 18 multi-omics cancer datasets from the database "The Cancer Genome Atlas", containing from 35 to 1,000 observations and from 60,000 to 100,000 variables. The considered outcome was the (censored) survival time. Twelve methods based on boosting, penalized regression and random forest were compared, comprising both methods that do and that do not take the group structure of the omics variables into account. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and a Cox model using only clinical variables were used as reference methods. The methods were compared using several repetitions of 5-fold cross-validation. Uno's C-index and the integrated Brier-score served as performance metrics. The results show that, although multi-omics data can improve the prediction performance, this is not generally the case. Only the method block forest slightly outperformed the Cox model on average over all datasets. Taking into account the multi-omics structure improves the predictive performance and protects variables in low-dimensional groups—especially clinical variables—from not being included in the model. All analyses are reproducible using freely available R code.},
annote = {Key Points
For the collection of the datasets used in this study, the standard Cox model only using clinical variables is very competitive compared with complex methods using multi-omics data. Among the investigated complex methods, only block forest outperforms the Cox model on average over all datasets, and the difference is not statistically significant.
If multi-omics data is used, its structure should be used as well: on average it increases the predictive performance and prevents low-dimensional feature groups from being discounted.
Favoring clinical variables over molecular data increases the prediction performance of the investigated methods on average.
In general, the findings indicate that assessing and comparing prediction methods should be based on a large number of datasets to reach robust conclusions.
Aside from the main results of the study, we also observed that using multi-omics data can improve the performance of prediction methods for particular datasets, but the average performance was not improved for the data investigated in our study.

abstract = {An important application of DNA microarray data is cancer classification. Because of the high-dimensionality problem of microarray data, gene selection approaches are often employed to support the expert systems in diagnostic capability of cancer with high classification accuracy. Penalized logistic regression using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) is one of the key steps in high-dimensional cancer classification, as gene coefficient estimation and gene selection simultaneously. However, the LASSO has been criticized for being biased in gene selection. The adaptive LASSO (APLR) was originally proposed to overcome the selection bias by assigning a consistent weight to each gene. In high-dimensional data, however, the adaptive LASSO faces practical problems in choosing the type of initial weight. In practice, the LASSO estimator itself has been used as an initial weight. However, this may not be preferable because the LASSO is inconsistent in itself. To address this issue, an alternative initial weight in adaptive penalized logistic regression (CBPLR) is proposed. The effectiveness of the CBPLR is examined on three well-known high-dimensional cancer classification datasets using number of selected genes, area under the curve, and misclassification rate. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CBPLR is quite efficient and feasible for cancer classification. Additionally, the proposed weight is compared with APLR and LASSO and exhibits competitive performance in both classification accuracy and gene selection. The proposed CBPLR has significant impact in penalized logistic regression by selecting fewer genes with high area under the curve and low misclassification rate. Thus, the proposed weight could conceivably be used in other research that implements gene selection in the field of high dimensional cancer classification.},

abstract = {microRNAs are noncoding RNAs which downregulate a large number of target mRNAs and modulate cell activity. Despite continued progress, bioinformatics prediction of microRNA targets remains a challenge since available software still suffer from a lack of accuracy and sensitivity. Moreover, these tools show fairly inconsistent results from one another. Thus, in an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, we aggregated all human results of four important prediction algorithms (miRanda, PITA, SVmicrO, and TargetScan) showing additional characteristics in order to rerank them into a single list. Instead of deciding which prediction tool to use, our method clearly helps biologists getting the best microRNA target predictions from all aggregated databases. The resulting database is freely available through a webtool called miRabel1 which can take either a list of miRNAs, genes, or signaling pathways as search inputs. Receiver operating characteristic curves and precision-recall curves analysis carried out using experimentally validated data and very large data sets show that miRabel significantly improves the prediction of miRNA targets compared to the four algorithms used separately. Moreover, using the same analytical methods, miRabel shows significantly better predictions than other popular algorithms such as MBSTAR, miRWalk, ExprTarget and miRMap. Interestingly, an F-score analysis revealed that miRabel also significantly improves the relevance of the top results. The aggregation of results from different databases is therefore a powerful and generalizable approach to many other species to improve miRNA target predictions. Thus, miRabel is an efficient tool to guide biologists in their search for miRNA targets and integrate them into a biological context.},

The genomic landscape of HNSCC has been recently described by numerous studies; however clinical utility studies are absent. Methods: We describe next generation sequencing (NGS) results and clinical out- comes of eight patients with advanced recurrent HPV-negative HNSCC. NGS platform (FoundationOneTM) included the coding sequence of 236 cancer-related genes and 47 introns. Results: All eight cases harbored ≥1 Genomic alterations (GA) accumulating to a total of 31 GA (average 3.9/tumor): the most common GA were; 10 in TP53 (6 tumors) and 5 in CDKN2A. Three GA were associated with FDA-approved drugs for HNSCC (EGFR amplifi- cation; Cetuximab), or other tumors (mTOR inhibitors - FBXW7-R465C; BRAF inhibitors - BRAF-K601E). Clinical trials associated with specific gene alterations were found to be applicable in all cases. Conclusions: NGS in HNSCC is clinically feasible, revealing actionable GA in a high percentage of patients. Larger studies with access to early-phase clinical trials should im- prove outcome.

Our objective was to systematically review the literature and conduct a meta-analysis of studies that investigated the prognostic significance of lymph node yield and/or lymph node density after neck dissection for patients with head and neck cancer. Data Sources: The Ovid/Medline, Ovid/Embase, and NLM PubMed databases were systematically searched on January 23, 2017, for articles published between January 1, 1946, and January 23, 2017. Review Methods: We reviewed English-language original research that included survival analysis of patients undergoing neck dissection for a head and neck malignancy stratified by lymph node yield and/or lymph node density. Study data were extracted by 2 independent researchers (S.C. and M.O.). We utilized the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to account for heterogeneity of studies. Results: Our search yielded 350 nonduplicate articles, with 23 studies included in the final synthesis. Pooled results demonstrated that increased lymph node yield was associated with a significant improvement in survival (hazard ratio, 0.833; 95{\%} CI, 0.790-0.879). Additionally, we found that increased lymph node density was associated with poorer survival (hazard ratio, 1.916; 95{\%} CI, 1.637-2.241). Conclusions: Increased nodal yield portends improved outcomes and may be a valuable quality indicator for neck dissections, while increased lymph node density is associated with diminished survival and may be used for postsurgical counseling and planning for adjuvant therapy.},

abstract = {The median overall survival (OS) of some head and neck malignancies, such as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with metastatic lesions was only 12 months. Whether aggressive pulmonary metastasectomy (PM) improves survival is controversial. Patients with primary head and neck malignancy undergoing PM were enrolled. Clinical outcomes were compared among different histological types. Whole-exome sequencing was used for matched pulmonary metastatic samples. The genes where genetic variants have been identified were sent for analysis by DAVID, IPA, and STRING. Forty-nine patients with primary head and neck malignancies were enrolled. Two-year postmetastasectomy survival (PMS) rates of adenoid cystic carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and HNSCC were 100{\%}, 88.2{\%}, 71.4{\%}, and 59.2{\%}, respectively (P = 0.024). In HNSCC, the time to distant metastasis was an independent predictive factor of the efficacy of PM. Several pathways, such as branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) consumption, were significantly associated with the progression of HNSCC [P {\textless} 0.001, fold enrichment (FE) = 5.45]. Moreover, metabolism-associated signaling pathways also seemed to be involved in cancer metastasis. Histological types and time to distant metastasis were important factors influencing the clinical outcomes of PM. For HNSCC, metabolic-associated signaling pathways were significantly associated with tumor progression and distant metastasis. Future validations are warranted.},

The study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board of TPE-VGH (IRB No. 2016-01-011CC). Informed consent was obtained according to the guidelines of the institutional review board of TPE-VGH

First, DAVID and IPA were used to reveal signal transduction pathways and networks of the genes identifying from the signal pathways, respectively. Then, GO was analyzed by using DAVID and STRING individually, and comparing whether GO terms from these two databases were the same. The genes, which appeared in signal pathways and had the same GO terms, were selected as candidate genes. In vitro cellular functional experiments and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of tissue samples were perform to validate these candidate genes.

abstract = {In the early 1900s, George Crile recognized that cancer of the head and neck was primarily a locoregional disease and felt that patients could be cured if the cancer was completely excised. The cervical lymph nodes were recognized as the initial area of spread and so the best chance for cure was excision of the primary cancer sites in concert with the ipsilateral cervical soft tissue. 1 He described and popularized radical neck dissections for the treatment of regionally metastatic head and neck cancer. Crile's radical neck dissection remained the standard of care for cervical metastases for almost 70 years. Modifications of the traditional radical neck dissection came after 1963, when Suarez demonstrated that the nonlymphatic structures (sternocleidomastoid muscle and internal jugular vein) were anatomically separated by fascia from the lymph nodes. Oncologic outcomes were found to be similar to radical neck dissections, and the functional and aesthetic outcomes of patients were clearly superior. 2 3 4 In addition, particularly with the advent of radiation therapy, preservation of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was found to protect the carotid artery from subsequent damage and potential blowout. 5 Several classification schemes for a neck dissection were introduced, and in an effort to present a common language the Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology of the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery introduced the most widely accepted classification system in 1991. A modified radical neck dissection was defined as “the excision of all lymph nodes routinely removed by the radical neck dissection, with preservation of one or more non-lymphatic structures.” 6 Key Operative Learning Points • Modified radical neck dissection is strictly defined as the removal of lymph nodes from levels 1 to 5 while preserving one or more of the nonlymphatic structures (sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal accessory nerve, internal jugular vein). • Decisions to perform a modified radical neck dissection are often made intraoperatively, when those nonlymphatic structures are found to be involved with cancer. • Preservation of the spinal accessory nerve maintains normal shoulder function. • Neck dissections can be done safely when the surgeon has thorough knowledge of the anatomy. • Soft tissue in level 4 should be clamped and ligated to prevent chyle leaks. • Manipulation of the carotid artery can cause excessive stimulation of the carotid body reflex, resulting in bradycardia and hypotension. This can be resolved with injection of lidocaine directly into the carotid sinus. • When approaching the carotid sheath, it is important to keep the plane of dissection over the jugular vein to prevent inadvertent damage to the sympathetic trunk, vagus nerve, or carotid artery.},

METHODS: A multicentred, retrospective cohort study of peripheral lymph node biopsies in HIV-positive adults was carried out. A total of 107 charts were identified and reviewed for clinical features, lymphadenopathy size, and ARV use and duration. Biopsy results were categorized, and multivariate logistic regression determined independent predictors of lymphadenopathy aetiology. RESULTS: Evaluation of 107 peripheral lymph node biopsies revealed that 42.9{\%} of peripheral lymphadenopathy was attributable to malignancy, 49.5{\%} to reactive changes, and 7.5{\%} to infections, with only 2.8{\%} of all cases secondary to tuberculosis. Fevers, weight loss, ARV use, and lower viral loads are significantly associated with nonreactive lymphadenopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphadenopathy is likely to be reactive or malignant in nontuberculosis endemic regions. Readily available clinical features can aid clinicians in predicting the underlying aetiology, those at risk for malignancy, and who to biopsy.},

Treatment with the EpCAM-neutralizing antibody EpAb2-6 inhibited AKT and FOXO3a phosphorylation, increased FOXO3a nuclear translocation, and upregulated HtrA2 expression to promote apoptosis while decreasing PD-L1 protein levels to enhance the cytotoxic activity of CD8+ T cells. In vivo, EpAb2-6 markedly extended survival in mouse metastasis and orthotopic models of human colorectal cancer. The combination of EpAb2-6 with Atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, almost completely eliminated tumors. Moreover, the number of CD8+ T cells in combination-treated tumors was increased compared to Atezolizumab alone. Our findings suggest a new combination strategy for cancer immunotherapy in patients with EpCAM-expressing tumors. [ received:2020/09/22, revised:2020/04/18, accepted:2020/07/17, entrez:2020/9/26 ]},

abstract = {Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used for chemotherapy of many malignancies, especially of oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, because the mechanism of resistance to CDDP is unclear, we established a CDDP-resistant cell line, Sa-3R, from a CDDP-sensitive cell line, Sa-3, which was derived from moderately differentiated SCC of the lower gingiva. The 3-(3,4-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay indicated that Sa-3R has 7.5-fold greater resistance to CDDP than Sa-3. Comparing gene expression levels in the cell lines using an in-house cDNA microarray, which represented 2,201 oral disease origin genes, many differentially expressed genes were identified. The ATP-binding cassette transporter genes (MDR-1, MRP-1, and MRP-2), and FANCONI, GRP58, FLJ12089, and SPINT-2 were up-regulated, whereas FOSL1, MRPS27, and PGK-1 were down-regulated. These results were confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The Sa-3/Sa-3R cell lines could be useful to identify the candidates responsible for the mechanism of CDDP-resistance and the up- or down-regulated genes identified by the gene expression profiles in the Sa-3R cell line may be, in part, associated with the mechanism.},

abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

RNA-sequencing data take the form of counts, so models based on the Gaussian distribution are unsuitable. Moreover, normalization is challenging because different sequencing experiments may generate quite different total numbers of reads. To overcome these difficulties, we use a log-linear model with a new approach to normalization. We derive a novel procedure to estimate the false discovery rate (FDR). Our method can be applied to data with quantitative, two-class, or multiple-class outcomes, and the computation is fast even for large data sets. We study the accuracy of our approaches for significance calculation and FDR estimation, and we demonstrate that our method has potential advantages over existing methods that are based on a Poisson or negative binomial model.

abstract = {Background: The extent of surgical safety margin (gross tumor border to resection margin) in oral cancer surgery remains unclear, and no study has determined the differential impact of close surgical margin and microscopic extension according to primary tumor size in oral cancers. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 325 patients with surgically treated oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas to determine the effect of a close surgical margin ({\textless}5 mm) (cSM5) on local recurrence. In addition, the depth of microscopic tumor infiltration was determined in 90 available surgical specimens. Results: The cSM5 was not related to the risk of local tumor recurrence in early-stage oral cancer, while it significantly increased the rate of local tumor recurrence in resectable advanced-stage oral cancers (hazard ratio 3.157, 95 {\%} confidence interval 1.050–9.407, p = 0.041). Addition of postoperative adjuvant radiation to early-stage tumors with cSM5 did not further reduce the local recurrence rate compared to surgery alone. The depth of microscopic tumor extension from the gross tumor border was significantly associated with primary tumor thickness ($\rho$ = 0.390, p {\textless} 0.001) and tumor sizes ($\rho$ = 0.308, p = 0.003), which was a median (range) of 0.84 (0.14–2.32) mm in T1, 1.06 (0.20–4.34) mm in T2, and 1.77 (0.13–4.70) mm in T3–4. Conclusions: The cSM5 was a significant risk factor for local recurrence only in advanced oral cancers, but not in early-stage tumors, where microscopic tumor extension was not beyond 3 mm in T1 tumors. Thus, the extent of surgical safety margin can be redefined according to the primary tumor size.},

abstract = {With the mechanistic understanding of immune checkpoints and success in checkpoint blockade using antibodies for the treatment of certain cancers, immunotherapy has become one of the hottest areas in cancer research, with promise of long-lasting therapeutic effect. Currently, however, only a proportion of cancers have a good response to checkpoint inhibition immunotherapy. Better understanding of the cancer response and resistance mechanisms is essential to fully explore the potential of immunotherapy to cure the majority of cancers. Bladder cancer, one of the most common and aggressive malignant diseases, has been successfully treated both at early and advanced stages by different immunotherapeutic approaches, bacillus Calmette–Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) intravesical instillation and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade, respectively. Therefore, it provides a good model to investigate cancer immune response mechanisms and to improve the efficiency of immunotherapy. Here, we review bladder cancer immunotherapy with equal weight on BCG and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies and demonstrate why and how bladder cancer can be used as a model to study the predictors and mechanisms of cancer immune response and shine light on further development of immunotherapy approaches and response predictive biomarkers to improve immunotherapy of bladder cancer and other malignancies. We review the success of BCG and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment of bladder cancer, the underlying mechanisms and the therapeutic response predictors, including the limits to our knowledge. We then highlight briefly the adaptation of immunotherapy approaches and predictors developed in other cancers for bladder cancer therapy. Finally, we explore the potential of using bladder cancer as a model to investigate cancer immune response mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches, which may be translated into immunotherapy of other human cancers. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Authors.

6.2.1.2 Factors Determining Surgical Margin Status
Factors Determining Surgical Margin StatusVarious factors can contribute towards surgical margin status. This include method of fixation of specimen, tumor site, choice of surgical approach, pattern of invasion, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, tumor size, grade of tumor, and skill of surgeon.

Sutton et al. [39] in a series of 200 consecutive patients who underwent primary surgical resection for oral cancer investigated various factors that can contribute to the close or positive margin. They used Batsakis classification of surgical margin in this series and observed 42{\%} close and 4.5{\%} positive margin. The close or positive margins were associated with large size tumor ({\textgreater}2cm), perineural invasion, lym-phovascular invasion, high-grade tumor, and invasive tumor front. However the sur-gical margin did not correlate with the surgical access and between surgeons. This implies that close or positive margin is a product of aggressive tumor rather than inadequate surgical technique.

This further underscores the fact that positive margin is a marker of aggressive tumor biology. [28]

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Half of the patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) can be expected to fail therapy, indicating that more aggressive treatment is warranted for this group. We have developed a novel risk model that can become a basis for developing new treatment paradigms. Here we report on the performance of our model in a new multicenter cohort. DESIGN: Eligible patients from 3 institutions (Montefiore Medical Center, University of Manitoba, and New York University Medical Center) were identified and pathology slides from their resection specimens were reviewed by Margaret Brandwein-Gensler; risk category was assigned as previously published. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for disease progression and survival. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed, adjusted for potential confounders. A teaching module was also developed; attending pathologists were asked to score coded slides after a lecture and multiheaded microscope teaching session. Agreement was assessed by calculating Cohen unweighted $\kappa$ coefficients. RESULT: The validation cohort consisted of 305 patients, from the above institutions, with 311 primary HNSCC of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx. The median follow-up period for all patients was 27 months. Risk category predicts time to disease progression (P=0.0005), locoregional recurrence (P=0.013), and overall survival (P=0.0000) by Kaplan-Meier analysis. High-risk status is significantly associated with decreased time to disease progression, adjusted for clinical confounders (P=0.015, hazard ratio 2.32, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.18-4.58) compared with collapsed intermediate and low-risk groups. We also demonstrate substantial interrater agreement ($\kappa$=0.64), and very good rater agreement when compared with the standard ($\kappa$=0.87). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate significant predictive performance of the risk model in a new cohort of patients with primary HNSCC, adjusted for confounders. Our training experience also supports the feasibility of adapting the risk model in clinical practice. {\textcopyright} 2010 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins.},

abstract = {Background. Controversy exists over the predictive value of the presence and pattern of tumor invasion of the mandible in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Many authors have questioned increasing the classification of small tumors to T4 on the basis of mandibular invasion alone. There are little data on the influence of the pattern of invasion on prognosis. Methods. We prospectively reviewed 100 consecutive mandibular resections for previously untreated oral SCC. Clinical and pathologic data collected included details of soft and hard tissue histologic findings. Outcomes included recurrence (local, regional, and distant metastases), disease-specific survival, and death from other causes. The median follow-up for survivors was 65 months. Results. Of 100 cases, 65 involved segmental and 35 involved marginal resections. Sixty-two percent of mandibles were invaded by tumor. Local recurrence occured in 21{\%} and was strongly correlated with tumor size, nodal involvement, and pattern of soft tissue invasion. The 5-year disease-specific survival was 68{\%}, and the crude survival was 50{\%}. Mandibular invasion predicted for recurrence and disease-specific survival, even after correcting for the effects of other variables. The pattern of mandibular invasion (erosive/infiltrative) was also predictive for recurrence and disease-specific survival. Conclusions. Even in the presence of mandibular invasion, soft tissue factors are the most important determinants of prognosis. Upstaging tumors on the basis of mandibular invasion is justified. An infiltrative pattern of bone invasion is a marker of aggressive tumor biology and should be included in the pTNM classification. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals Inc.},

We show that tumors with transcriptionally inactive HPV16 (DNA+ RNA-) are similar to HPV-negative (DNA-) tumors regarding gene expression and frequency of TP53 mutations (47{\%}, 8/17 and 43{\%}, 72/167, respectively). We also find that an immune response-related gene expression cluster is associated with lymph node metastasis, independent of HPV16 status and that disruptive TP53 mutations are associated with lymph node metastasis in HPV16 DNA- tumors. We validate each of these associations in another large data set. Four gene expression clusters which we identify differ moderately but significantly in overall survival. Our findings underscore the importance of measuring the HPV16 RNA (E6∗I) and TP53-mutation status for patient stratification and identify associations of an immune response-related gene expression cluster and TP53 mutations with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC.},

abstract = {Expression of EGF receptor (EGFR) is frequently elevated in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been shown to improve overall survival in patients with locally advanced SCCHN when combined with radiotherapy. Data from Phase II trials suggest an interesting activity of cetuximab in patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN who are refractory to cisplatin. The Erbitux in First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer (EXTREME) Phase III trial compared platin-5-fluorouracil alone versus combined with cetuximab as first-line treatment in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN. In the cetuximab arm of this study, a significant improvement in the overall survival (the main objective), progression-free survival and response rate were observed. The quality of life analyses (QLQ-C30 and QLQ-H{\&}N35) showed no significant differences in most of the studied scores between the two treatment arms. Nevertheless, patients in the cetuximab arm displayed significant improvements in pain, swallowing problems and scores for speech and social eating problems. The results of the EXTREME study (and other studies evaluating cetuximab for the treatment of SCCHN) suggest a lack of a predictive value for the expression of EGFR (determined by immunohistochemistry) by the tumor and other biomarkers need to be investigated. The role of other targeted drugs and of possible combinations of these new drugs with cetuximab should be investigated in properly designed preclinical studies and clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2009 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

abstract = {As a person with hemophilia (PWH), my passion led me to conduct personal research to uncover the main cause of my drawbacks in my education, my career, and my romantic life. I have experienced unjustified conflicts in my social relations, feeling stale in mind and body, indefinite self-image, emotional instability, and successive spontaneous bleeds despite the continuous factor replacement. My research is based on my experience of living with hemophilia for 37 years, reading countless books on personal development and the mind-body relationship, and having profound discussions about these experiences with my wife. Findings: Through my research, I uncovered that I used to suffer from what I call 'mind inhibitors' these were the hidden cause of my life disorders and spontaneous bleeds. These mind inhibitors are responsible for locking the body factor receptors, blocking body energy centres (like the solar plexus), discouraging the super-intelligent body cells from running their auto-healing system, and paralyzing the instinctive high-speed cellular response to external molecular treatment. Mind inhibitors originate from different sources like thinking of oneself in a victim role, anxiety about medical treatments, lack of financial stability, negative attitudes, self-rejection, and contradictory thoughts and feelings. Conclusion: Mind inhibitors should be handled as seriously as biological inhibitors. As Dr. Bruce Lipton explains in his book, 'The Biology of Belief': DNA does not control our biology; instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell. Our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking, since thoughts are made of energy that affects the cellular energy level, and thus everything is created twice: once in our minds and then the physical creation follows. New holistic approaches should be considered for treating PWH as a complete synchronized system of Soul, Mind, and Body; treatment should include more than just factor adjustment. Factor adjustment only treats symptoms, but a holistic approach would also address the patient's need for a subconscious paradigm shift in the person's thought and belief system.},

abstract = {Originally based on the halstedian principles of en bloc removal of lymph nodes in the neck, neck dissection is a standard procedure for the management of patients with head and neck tumors. The term neck dissection has evolved to encompass several different forms of the procedure, which may be selected based on the nature of the patient's disease. Neck dissection was first described in the late nineteenth century by von Langenbeck, Billroth, von Volkmann, and Kocher, who developed and reported the early cases of different types of neck dissection. Butlin, in England, developed the concept of elective neck dissection. However, it was George Crile, in 1906, who reported the first significant series of cases on radical neck dissection, bringing this procedure to the attention of the medical world as an effective operation with reproducible techniques and results. 1 The greatest impetus to the status of this surgical procedure came from Martin et al. 2 In 1951, these researchers published a monumental report of 1,450 cases that established the place and technique of radical neck dissection in the modern treatment of head and neck cancer. The traditional radical neck dissection now is reserved for patients with bulky metastatic neck disease and those with a regional failure after a more limited neck dissection. In 1967, Bocca described the concept of a functional neck dissection with limited surgical morbidity, for which the oncologic safety was equivalent to that of a radical neck dissection.},

abstract = {Gene expression signatures generated from DNA microarray analyses have shown promise  as predictive biomarkers of clinical outcome. In this study, we determined a high-risk signature for disease recurrence using formalin-fixed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors and compared the results with an independent data set obtained from fresh frozen tumors. We also showed that genes involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling deregulation are the most prominent molecular characteristics of the high-risk tumors. Gene expression was determined in 40 samples, including 34 formalin-fixed tissues and 6 matched frozen tissues, from 29 HNSCC patients. A 75-gene list predictive of disease recurrence was determined by training on the formalin-fixed tumor data set and tested on data from the independent frozen tumor set from 60 HNSCC patients. The difference in recurrence-free survival (RFS) between the high-risk versus low-risk groups in the training and test sets was statistically significant (P = 0.002 and 0.03, respectively, log-rank test). In addition, the gene expression data was interrogated using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to determine biological significance. The most significant sets of genes enriched in the high-risk tumors were genes involving EMT, NF-kappaB activation, and cell adhesion. In conclusion, global gene expression analysis is feasible using formalin-fixed tissue. The 75-gene list can be used as a prognostic biomarker of recurrence, and our data suggest that the molecular determinants of EMT and NF-kappaB activation can be targeted as the novel therapy in the identified high-risk patients.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a major health concern worldwide. We applied the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to analyze paired normal (N) and tumor (T) samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in HNSCC cell lines to identify tumor-associated biomarkers. Our results showed a number of proteins found to be over- expressed in HNSCC. We identified thymosin beta-4 X-linked (TMSB4X) is one of the most significant candidate biomarkers. Higher TMSB4X expression in the tumor was found by N/T-paired HNSCC samples at both RNA and protein level. Overexpression of TMSB4X was found significantly associated with poor prognosis of overall survival (OS, P = 0.006) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.013) in HNSCC patients. Silencing of TMSB4X expression in HNSCC cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro, as well as inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. Altogether, our global proteomics analysis identified that TMSB4X is a newly discovered biomarker in HNSCC whose functions resulted in enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. TMSB4X may be a potential therapeutic target for treating HNSCC patients.},

abstract = {PET-CT is probably the ultimate tool for accurate tumor imaging and 3-dimensional in vivo predictive assay of radiation sensitivity. By imaging the tumor twice during the early course of therapy, it should be possible to quantify both the tumor responsiveness to therapy and the rate of loss of functional tumor cells using the presently derived equations. This new information is ideal for use together with biologically based therapy optimization and makes it possible accurately to quantitate the dose-response relation, at least for the bulk of the tumor cells. Since the tumor responsiveness is available after about one and a half weeks of therapy, the information is also ideal for use with adaptive therapy where all forms of deviations from the original treatment plan can be accurately corrected for since they generally influence the still functional, but mainly doomed tumor cell compartment. Thus, uncertainties such as: 1) the geometric misalignment of the therapeutic beam with the tumor, 2) deviations of the delivered dose distribution from the planned delivery whether due to 3) an erroneous treatment planning algorithm or 4) treatment equipment uncertainties and 5) deviations in the anticipated responsiveness of the tumor of the patient based on historical response data, can all be taken into account. Fortunately, when a larger tumor cell compartment than expected is seen an increased dose during the remainder of the treatment should always be delivered independently on whichever combination of the above deviations was the true reason. With high-energy photon and hadron therapy it is even possible to image the integral dose delivery in vivo during or after a treatment using PET-CT imaging. The high-energy photons above about 20 MeV produce positron emitters through photonuclear reactions in tissue which are proportional to the photon fluence and thus approximately also to the absorbed dose. Light ion beams, the ultimate radiation modality with regard to physical and biological selectivity, instead produce PET emitters through direct nuclear interactions in tissue, but can also be used as radioactive beams consisting of intrinsic PET emitters such as 8B, 11C, 13N and 15O. These radioactive beams allow more accurate imaging of the Bragg peak distribution and thus indirectly the absorbed dose. The most universal feedback for adaptive radiation therapy would then be to use the measured image of mean dose delivery during the early part of the treatment while revising the treatment plan based on the initially planned dose distribution and the radiation responsiveness of the tumor as seen after the first week or two of therapy. By this so-called BIO-ART approach (Biologically Optimized 3D in vivo predictive Assay-based Radiation Therapy) radiation therapy optimization may become an almost exact science, where the patient's true individual radiation response, considering hypoxia and general radiation resistance as well as possible dose delivery and planning errors, is taken into account.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer experience psychological distress, accompanied by reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) and altered levels of cytokines, which may compromise cancer control. Few studies have evaluated psycho-immune outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in comparison to an active control condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether MBSR benefits psychological, behavioral, and immunological function in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: After confirmation of breast cancer staging, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (n = 192) were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or an 8-week active control condition (ACC). The ACC consisted of a series of cancer recovery and health education classes. Both MBSR and the ACC were administered in group format. METHODS: Women completed psychometric instruments and provided blood for NKCA and cytokine levels at pre-, mid-, and completion of program, as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. One hundred and twenty four women completed all five-assessments (MBSR, n = 63; ACC, n = 61). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze trajectories of outcomes over time and between groups. RESULTS: Compared to the ACC group, women randomized to MBSR exhibited decreasing trajectories of perceived stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms. Further, compared to women randomized to ACC, MBSR women exhibited trajectories demonstrating significantly more rapid restoration of NKCA, accompanied by lower circulating TNF-alpha levels, lower IL-6 production, and greater IFN-gamma production. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate early provision of MBSR for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer provides not only psychological benefit, but also optimizes immune function supportive of cancer control.},

IL-6/IL-6R signaling pathway, in particular, has been proposed to be a pivotal cytokine promoting ovarian cancer progression. This study aimed to elucidate potential clinical and biological function of IL-6R mRNA expression in ovarian cancer. We used the keywords "ovarian cancer" and searched through GEO database and finally a total of 7 studies together with TCGA database were incorporated in this analysis. We used Cutoff Finder to determine a cutoff point and stratified patients into two groups and found that high-expression of IL-6R mRNA in tumor tissues was a positive prognostic factor for overall survival. Simultaneously, high expression level of IL-6R mRNA correlates with better survival of patients who had additional chemotherapy treatment. These analyses suggested a possible role of tumoral expression of IL-6R in ovarian cancer. In conclusion, our results showed that mRNA levels of IL-6R in ovarian cancer was positively associated with better prognosis and sensitivity to chemotherapy and can potentially be used as a prognostic marker for this cancer.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to analyzing protein sequence databases that, starting from a single uncharacterized sequence or group of related sequences, generates blocks of conserved segments. The procedure involves iterative database scans with an evolving position-dependent weight matrix constructed from a coevolving set of aligned conserved segments. For each iteration, the expected distribution of matrix scores under a random model is used to set a cutoff score for the inclusion of a segment in the next iteration. This cutoff may be calculated to allow the chance inclusion of either a fixed number or a fixed proportion of false positive segments. With sufficiently high cutoff scores, the procedure converged for all alignment blocks studied, with varying numbers of iterations required. Different methods for calculating weight matrices from alignment blocks were compared. The most effective of those tested was a logarithm-of-odds, Bayesian-based approach that used prior residue probabilities calculated from a mixture of Dirichlet distributions. The procedure described was used to detect novel conserved motifs of potential biological importance.},

abstract = {Stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1) has been recently identified as a released biomarker in human ovarian cancer. In addition, STIP1 secreted by human ovarian cancer cells has been shown to promote tumor cell proliferation by binding to ALK2 (activin A receptor, type II-like kinase 2) and activating the SMAD-ID3 signaling pathways. In this study, a total of 330 ovarian cancer tumor samples were evaluated for STIP1 expression by immunohistochemistry and analyzed for a possible correlation with patient characteristics and survival. The quantification of immunoreactivity was accomplished by applying an immunohistochemical scoring system (histoscore). Patients with high-level STIP1 expression (histoscore ≥169) had a significantly worse survival (high STIP1, mean survival time = 76 months; low STIP1, mean survival time = 112 months; P{\textless}0.0001). Moreover, STIP1 histoscores were significantly higher in high-grade tumors (grade 3) than in low-grade (grade 1-2) malignancies (P{\textless}0.0001), suggesting that STIP1 may be a proxy for tumor aggressiveness. The results of multivariable analysis revealed that high STIP1 histoscores, advanced stages, histologic types, and the presence of residual disease (≥2 cm) were independent predictors of poor prognosis. The addition of STIP1 histoscores improved the prediction of overall and progression-free survival rates in the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model. The treatment of ovarian cancer cells with recombinant STIP1 stimulated cell proliferation and migration, but co-treatment with anti-STIP1 antibodies abrogated this effect. Our findings suggest that STIP1 expression may be related to prognosis and that the STIP1 pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target for human ovarian cancer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Chao et al.},

abstract = {To be highly successful, a radiotherapeutic dose must be sufficiently large to destroy radioresistant tumors, yet avoid injuring the surrounding healthy tissue. However, many patients exhibit high radiosensitivity and may develop radiation-induced early and late side effects. Because the identification of these radiosensitive patients remains largely problematic, general radiotherapy protocols currently limit the dose given, which risks delivering an insufficient dose to a significant number of less sensitive patients. Therefore, one of the main current challenges of radiobiology is to predict a patient's tumor radioresistance and normal tissue radiosensitivity to tailor a personalized treatment to that individual. Although predictive assays exist, none has demonstrated highly significant results that would be useful in a clinical setting. Therefore, proteomics represents a promising approach for identifying new relevant predictive biomarkers. In this review, the authors first explain the main characteristics of tumor radioresistance and normal tissue radiosensitivity. The authors next describe the existing predictive assays. Finally, the proteomics studies performed to date to identify new biomarkers that probably predicts radiotherapy outcomes are discussed.},
annote = {Predictive Assays for Tumor Radioresistance 
Most predictive tests were first based on measuring the general tumor characteristics described below. The potential doubling time parameter, for example, is assessed to identify tumors in which significant cell proliferation occurs, despite cell loss.[13] Evaluation of the fraction of surviving cells at 2 Gy helps indicate the intrinsic radiosensitivity of a tumor.[14,15] A statistically significant correlation exists between cell survival at 2 Gy and the dose required to sterilize the original tumor. Similarly, measurement of a tumor's oxygen partial pressure indicates its level of hypoxia, which can help to predict its radiosensitivity.[16,17] Unfortunately, these parameters, even in combination, are insufficient to predict tumor radioresistance for clinical use. However, new tools are improving this science. For instance, functional imaging using PET recently allowed Brahme to differentiate radiosensitive and radioresistant tumors.[18] These results must still be validated in new independent cohorts. In conclusion, none of these assays offer predictive determination of tumoral radioresistance. Thus, new alternative approaches, notably proteomic investigations, have been developed.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a multinational, randomized study to compare radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor, in the treatment of locoregionally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. METHODS: Patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer were randomly assigned to treatment with high-dose radiotherapy alone (213 patients) or high-dose radiotherapy plus weekly cetuximab (211 patients) at an initial dose of 400 mg per square meter of body-surface area, followed by 250 mg per square meter weekly for the duration of radiotherapy. The primary end point was the duration of control of locoregional disease; secondary end points were overall survival, progression-free survival, the response rate, and safety. RESULTS: The median duration of locoregional control was 24.4 months among patients treated with cetuximab plus radiotherapy and 14.9 months among those given radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for locoregional progression or death, 0.68; P = 0.005). With a median follow-up of 54.0 months, the median duration of overall survival was 49.0 months among patients treated with combined therapy and 29.3 months among those treated with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.74; P = 0.03). Radiotherapy plus cetuximab significantly prolonged progression-free survival (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.70; P = 0.006). With the exception of acneiform rash and infusion reactions, the incidence of grade 3 or greater toxic effects, including mucositis, did not differ significantly between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer with concomitant highdose radiotherapy plus cetuximab improves locoregional control and reduces mortality without increasing the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy to the head and neck.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This article describes our experience with neck dissection in 10 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2007 and October 2009, 10 patients underwent primary surgery for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. For patients with N0 disease on clinical exam, selective neck dissection (SND [I-III]) was performed. In patients with palpable cervical metastases (N+), modified radical neck dissections were performed, except in one patient in whom SND (I-III) was performed. The histopathologic reports were reviewed to assess the surgical margins, the presence of extra-capsular spread, perineural invasion, and lymphatic invasion. RESULTS: On histopathologic examination, positive soft tissue margins were found in three patients, and regional lymph node metastases were present in five of the ten patients. Perineural invasion was noted in five patients, and extra nodal spread was found in four patients. Regional recurrence was seen in two patients and loco-regional recurrence plus distant metastasis to the tibia was observed in one patient. During the study period, three patients died. Seven patients remain free of disease to date. CONCLUSION: Histopathological evaluation provides important and reliable information for disease staging, treatment planning, and prognosis. The philosophy of neck dissection is evolving rapidly with regard to the selectivity with which at-risk lymph node groups are removed. The sample size in the present study is small, thus, caution should be employed when interpreting these results.},

abstract = {Background. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the pivotal role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks for predicting survival and evaluating prognosis in cancer patients. However, the pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains unclear, and prognostic biomarkers for HNSCC are still lacking. Methods. A total of 546 RNA sequencing profiles of HNSCC patients with clinical outcome data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, providing a large sample of RNA sequencing data. From these, 71 Long noncoding RNAs lncRNAs, 8 microRNAs (miRNAs), and 16 messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were identified to construct a HNSCC-specific ceRNA network (fold change {\textgreater}2, P {\textless} 0.05). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression models were used to assess independent indicators of prognosis. Then the expression of lncRNAs harboring prognostic value was validated in human HNSCC cell lines and tumor samples from our cohort and another two datasets from GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) databases. Results. As a result, a 3-mRNA signature and 6-lncRNA signature were identified. The six-lncRNA signature exhibited the highest prognostic value. Notably, in the six lncRNAs, HOTTIP showed the greatest prognostic value and was significantly correlated with clinical stage and histological grade of HNSCC patients. Furthermore, it was proved that HOTTIP was upregulated in HNSCC cell lines and cancerous tissues compared with corresponding normal cell lines and normal tissues. Functional assessment analysis revealed that HOTTIP might play a key role in the oncogenesis and progression of HNSCC. Conclusion . The present study deepened our understanding of the ceRNA-related regulatory mechanism in the pathogenesis of HNSCC and identified candidate prognostic biomarkers for clinical outcome prediction in HNSCC. HOTTIP may function as a key candidate biomarker in HNSCC and serve as a prognostic marker for HNSCC patients.},

In this study, we investigated in detail the expression of STIP1, as well as its functions, in EOC. STIP1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the results were compared with clinicopathologic factors, including survival data. The effects of STIP1 gene silencing via small interfering RNA (siRNA) were examined in EOC cells and a xenograft model. The expression of STIP1 protein in EOC was significantly higher than in the other study groups (P{\textless}0.001), and this increase of expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (P=0.005), tumor grade (P=0.029), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.020). In multivariate analysis, overall survival in EOC was significantly shorter in cases with high STIP1 expression (HR=2.78 [1.01-7.63], P=0.047). STIP1 silencing in EOC cells resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion. In addition, in vivo experiments using STIP1 siRNA clearly showed a strong inhibition of tumor growth and a modulation of expression of prosurvival and apoptotic genes, further suggesting that STIP1 silencing can prevent cell proliferation and invasion. In conclusion, increased STIP1 expression is associated with poor survival outcome in EOC, and STIP1 may represent a useful therapeutic target in EOC patients. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Methods: This was a retrospective analysis. As data sources, paper-based and digital patient files, as well as the Munich Cancer Registry database were used. Results: Three hundred ninety-six cases were included in this analysis. Only the evaluation of margins by the surgeon influenced local control, and the pathological results influenced disease-free survival (DFS). Surprisingly, margins of {\textgreater}5 mm of normal tissue to cancer growth led to local control and overall survival (OS) significantly worse than 1 to 5-mm resections. Conclusion: The evaluation of margins by the surgeon is of significant importance for local control and OS. It is largely based on frozen section analysis, which, therefore, should be used whenever possible.},

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary academic head and neck cancer program. Subjects and Methods: This study included 426 patients treated with OCSCC resection between 2005 and 2014 at University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Patients underwent excision of OCSCC with intraoperative tumor bed frozen margin sampling and main specimen permanent margin assessment. Multivariate analysis of the data set to predict LR and OS was performed. Results: Independent predictors of LR included nodal involvement, histologic grade, and main specimen permanent margin status. Specifically, the presence of a positive margin (odds ratio, 6.21; 95{\%} CI, 3.3-11.9) or {\textless}1-mm/carcinoma in situ margin (odds ratio, 2.41; 95{\%} CI, 1.19-4.87) on the main specimen was an independent predictor of LR, whereas intraoperative tumor bed margins were not predictive of LR on multivariate analysis. Similarly, independent predictors of OS on multivariate analysis included nodal involvement, extracapsular extension, and a positive main specimen margin. Tumor bed margins did not independently predict OS. Conclusion: The main specimen margin is a strong independent predictor of LR and OS on multivariate analysis. Intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins do not independently predict prognosis. We conclude that emphasis should be placed on evaluating the main specimen margins when estimating prognosis after OCSCC resection.},

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to detect serum levels of STIP1 autoantibodies in a training cohort (148 ESCC patients and 111 controls) and a validation cohort (60 ESCC patients and 40 controls). Mann-Whitney's U test showed that ESCC patients in two cohorts have higher levels of autoantibodies against STIP1 when compared to controls (P{\textless}0.001). According to receiver operating characteristic analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of autoantibodies against STIP1 in ESCC were 41.9{\%}, 90.1{\%}, and 0.682 in the training cohort and 40.0{\%}, 92.5{\%}, and 0.710 in the validation cohort, respectively.

abstract = {CONCLUSIONS: Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a novel prognostic biomarker for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). DKK1 may be a promising strategy for the future treatment of LSCC metastasis and recurrence. OBJECTIVES: DKK1 is reportedly involved in the metastasis and invasion of several tumor types. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of DKK1 in LSCC. METHODS: DKK1 expression was measured in Hep-2 cell lines, as well as in tumor and peritumoral tissues, using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses. The role of DKK1 in LSCC was investigated by depleting DKK1 using small interfering RNAs. Tissue microarrays of 102 LSCC patient samples were employed to immunohistochemically detect expression of DKK1, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), and $\beta$-catenin. Prognostic significance was assessed using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. RESULTS: DKK1 expression was elevated in the Hep-2 cell line and tumor samples. DKK1 depletion decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness. High DKK1 expression was significantly associated with T and clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size (p {\textless} 0.05). Increased DKK1 levels in LSCC tissues correlated with elevated VEGF-C and $\beta$-catenin. Multivariate analyses revealed that DKK1 was an unfavorable predictor of overall survival.},

abstract = {Background. Aberrations of the p53 gene and overexpression of its protein are widely recognized markers of malignancy including oral squamous cell carcinomas. This study was performed to evaluate the relationship of immunoexpression of p53 protein in series of 91 squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity with clinicopathologic parameters and to investigate whether p53 immunoexpression might influence the clinical outcome of the disease. Methods. From a group of 287 consecutive patients, 91 surgically treated ones were randomly selected. P53 protein expression was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry. Clinical and histopathologic data were gathered, and the patient survival was analyzed. Results. Of the oral carcinomas, 52.7{\%} (n = 48) overexpressed p53, using a threshold of 10{\%} stained cell nuclei. There was a negative correlation of p53 immunoexpression with a histologic grade of differentiation (r= -0.236, p =.06) but not with clinical variables. Overall survival rate was 59{\%} at 5 years. In univariate analysis, tumor size, node status, and advanced clinical stage were significantly associated with shortened overall survival. In patients without neck node metastases, p53 showed a strong correlation with survival (p = .01). In multivariate analysis performed only on NO patients, tumor extension and p53 immunoexpression were found to be the only independent prognostic parameters with relative risks of 1.9 and 4.3, respectively. Conclusions. A strong relationship was observed between p53 immunoexpression and poor prognosis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinomas without neck node metastases. {\textcopyright} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Although the large majority of cases resemble head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the current classification based on anatomic site and tumor stage fails to capture the high level of biologic heterogeneity, and appropriate clinical management remains a major challenge. Hence, a better understanding of the molecular biology of HNSCC is urgently needed to support biomarker development and personalized care for patients. This review focuses on recent findings based on integrative genomics analysis and multi-scale modeling approaches and how they are beginning to provide more sophisticated clues as to the biological and clinical diversity of HNSCC.},

abstract = {Gene or protein expression data are usually represented by metric or at least ordinal variables. In order to translate a continuous variable into a clinical decision, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point and to stratify patients into two groups each requiring a different kind of treatment. Currently, there is no standard method or standard software for biomarker cutoff determination. Therefore, we developed Cutoff Finder, a bundle of optimization and visualization methods for cutoff determination that is accessible online. While one of the methods for cutoff optimization is based solely on the distribution of the marker under investigation, other methods optimize the correlation of the dichotomization with respect to an outcome or survival variable. We illustrate the functionality of Cutoff Finder by the analysis of the gene expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) in breast cancer tissues. This distribution of these important markers is analyzed and correlated with immunohistologically determined ER status and distant metastasis free survival. Cutoff Finder is expected to fill a relevant gap in the available biometric software repertoire and will enable faster optimization of new diagnostic biomarkers.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether there is evidence of field cancerization in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) enrolled in a betel quid chewing area. We also assessed whether betel quid chewing is an independent risk factor for field cancerization in OSCC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 1570 OSCC patients who underwent radical tumor resection between 1996 and 2011. A total of 1243 study participants (79{\%}) had a positive history of betel quid chewing before surgery. Of the 767 patients treated with surgery alone, 599 (78{\%}) were preoperative chewers, whereas a history of preoperative betel quid chewing was identified in 644 (80{\%}) of the 803 patients who received adjuvant therapy. The 5-year control, survival, and second primary tumors (SPTs) rates served as the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Regardless of the treatment modality, more than 70{\%} of the SPTs were located in the oral cavity or soft palate. Despite a similar risk profile in terms of tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and pathological margin status, preoperative chewers showed a significantly higher incidence of 5-year SPTs and local recurrences compared with non-chewers. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative betel quid chewing was an independent prognostic factor for 5-year local control and SPTs occurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that preoperative betel quid chewers had a higher incidence of local recurrence and SPTs than non-chewers, suggesting that field cancerization may occur in OSCC patients with a history of betel quid chewing.},

In the context of cancer, contemporary investigations have primarily focused on just one type of functional relationship between two genes—synthetic lethality (SL). Here, we define the more general concept of “survival-associated pairwise gene expression states” (SPAGEs) as gene pairs whose joint expression levels are associated with survival. We describe a data-driven approach called SPAGE-finder that when applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data identified 71,946 SPAGEs spanning 12 distinct types, only a minority of which are SLs. The detected SPAGEs explain cancer driver genes' tissue specificity and differences in patients' response to drugs and stratify breast cancer tumors into refined subtypes. These results expand the scope of cancer SPAGEs and lay a conceptual basis for future studies of SPAGEs and their translational applications.},

abstract = {Objectives Treatment failure and poor 5-year survival in mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has remained unchanged for decades mainly due to advanced stage of presentation and high rates of recurrence. Incomplete surgical removal of the tumour, attributed to lack of reliable methods to delineate the surgical margins, is a major cause of disease recurrence. The predictability of recurrence using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to delineate surgical margins (PRISM) in mucosal HNSCC study aims to redefine margin status by identifying the true extent of the tumour at the molecular level by performing IHC with molecular markers, eukaryotic initiation factor, eIF4Eand tumour suppressor gene, p53, on the surgical margins and test the use of Lugol's iodine and fluorescence visualisation prior to the wide local excision. This article describes the study protocol at its pre - results stage. Methods and analysis PRISM-HNSCC is a bilateral observational research being conducted in Darwin, Australia and Vellore, India. Individuals diagnosed with HNSCC will undergo the routine wide local excision of the tumour followed by histopathological assessment. Tumours with clear surgical margins that satisfy the exclusion criteria will be selected for further staining of the margins with eIF4E and p53 antibodies. Results of IHC staining will be correlated with recurrences in an attempt to predict the risk of disease recurrence. Patients in Darwin will undergo intraoperative staining of the lesion with Lugol's iodine and fluorescence visualisation to delineate the excision margins while patients in Vellore will not undertake these tests. The outcomes will be analysed. Ethics and dissemination The PRISM-HNSCC study was approved by the institutional ethics committees in Darwin (Human Research Ethics Committee 13-2036) and Vellore (Institutional Review Board Min. no. 8967). Outcomes will be disseminated through publications in academic journals and presentations at educational meetings and conferences. It will be presented as dissertation at the Charles Darwin University. We will communicate the study results to both participating sites. Participating sites will communicate results with patients who have indicated an interest in knowing the results.

We wanted to understand the level of decompression stress fishermen in this region of the Yucatan experience in their daily fishing effort. We used a mathematical model to quantify nitrogen-loading in a nine-tissue compartment model. Materials and methods: Approved by the UCLA IRB 2 {\#}13-000532, this study was conducted during fishing seasons 2012 through 2017. Diving fishermen were instructed to attach dive recorders to their waists every fishing day during the study period. Sensus Ultra dive recorders (ReefNet Inc.), with an accuracy of +/-1 foot of seawater (fsw), 0.304 meters, and an activation depth of 10 fsw, 3.04 meters, were used to record dive parameters. Sampling interval was set to 10 seconds. A program in RStudio was created to extract the dive profiles of each fishing day and curtail into single-line outputs: pressure, time, date, start of dive and end of dive. An exponential decay formula was used to calculate the nitrogen-loading pressures for nine theoretical tissue compartments. Final nitrogen pressure, controlling compartments, decompression stop and time at stop were calculated. Results: Fishermen completed 4,961 dives over 1,758 diving days during the study period. The 40-minute compartment controlled most of the dives. The 80-minute compartment controlled 5{\%}-20{\%} of dives two through five. Decompression stop times for the last dive ranged from one minute to 190 minutes. Most of the required stop time observed was seen at depths of 1-15 fsw.},

abstract = {Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal mechanism for cancer dissemination. However, EMT-regulated individual cancer cell invasion is difficult to detect in clinical samples. Emerging evidence implies that EMT is correlated to collective cell migration and invasion with unknown mechanisms. We show that the EMT transcription factor Snail elicits collective migration in squamous cell carcinoma by inducing the expression of a tight junctional protein, claudin-11. Mechanistically, tyrosine-phosphorylated claudin-11 activates Src, which suppresses RhoA activity at intercellular junctions through p190RhoGAP, maintaining stable cell–cell contacts. In head and neck cancer patients, the Snail–claudin-11 axis prompts the formation of circulating tumour cell clusters, which correlate with tumour progression. Overexpression of snail correlates with increased claudin-11, and both are associated with a worse outcome. This finding extends the current understanding of EMT-mediated cellular migration via a non-individual type of movement to prompt cancer progression.},

A cohort of 200 consecutive patients with previously untreated OSCC provided the material for the study. Various clinical, operative and pathological parameters were related to the status of the surgical margin, as well as time to recurrence, and survival. Cox regression analysis of the survival was also undertaken. Of the 200 patients 107 (53.5{\%}) had clear margins, 84 (42{\%}) close and 9 (4.5{\%}) involved. Poor correlation was found between the status of the surgical margin and clinical factors, but in contrast high correlation between histological indicators of aggressive disease and close or involved surgical margins.

Accurate prognostic stratification of NSCLC can become an important clinical reference when designing therapeutic strategies for cancer patients. With this clinical application in mind, we developed a deep neural network (DNN) combining heterogeneous data sources of gene expression and clinical data to accurately predict the overall survival of NSCLC patients. Based on microarray data from a cohort set (614 patients), seven well-known NSCLC biomarkers were used to group patients into biomarker- and biomarker+ subgroups. Then, by using a systems biology approach, prognosis relevance values (PRV) were then calculated to select eight additional novel prognostic gene biomarkers. Finally, the combined 15 biomarkers along with clinical data were then used to develop an integrative DNN via bimodal learning to predict the 5-year survival status of NSCLC patients with tremendously high accuracy (AUC: 0.8163, accuracy: 75.44{\%}). Using the capability of deep learning, we believe that our prediction can be a promising index that helps oncologists and physicians develop personalized therapy and build the foundation of precision medicine in the future.},

In biomedical research, we are in the midst of a revolution with the generation of new data and scientific publications at a previously unprecedented rate. However, unfortunately, there is compelling evidence that the majority of these discoveries will not stand the test of time. To a large extent, this reproducibility crisis in basic and preclinical research may be as a result of failure to adhere to good scientific practice and the desperation to publish or perish. This is a multifaceted, multistakeholder problem. No single party is solely responsible, and no single solution will suffice. Here we review the reproducibility problems in basic and preclinical biomedical research, highlight some of the complexities, and discuss potential solutions that may help improve research quality and reproducibility.},

abstract = {Background: DNA methylation has started a recent revolution in genomics biology by identifying key biomarkers for multiple cancers, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), the most common head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: A multi-stage screening strategy was used to identify DNA-methylation-based signatures for OSCC prognosis. We used The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data as training set which were validated in two independent datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The correlation between DNA methylation and corresponding gene expression and the prognostic value of the gene expression were explored as well. Results: The seven DNA methylation CpG sites were identified which were significantly associated with OSCC overall survival. Prognostic signature, a weighted linear combination of the seven CpG sites, successfully distinguished the overall survival of OSCC patients and had a moderate predictive ability for survival [training set: hazard ratio (HR)=3.23, P=5.52×10-10, area under the curve (AUC)=0.76; validation set 1: HR=2.79, P=0.010, AUC=0.67; validation set 2: HR=3.69, P=0.011, AUC=0.66]. Stratification analysis by human papillomavirus status, clinical stage, age, gender, smoking status, and grade retained statistical significance. Expression of genes corresponding to candidate CpG sites (AJAP1, SHANK2, FOXA2, MT1A, ZNF570, HOXC4, and HOXB4) was also significantly associated with patient's survival. Signature integrating of DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinical information showed a superior ability for prognostic prediction (AUC=0.78). Conclusion: Prognostic signature integrated of DNA methylation, gene expression, and clinical information provides a better prognostic prediction value for OSCC patients than that with clinical information only.},

abstract = {Cancer hallmark genes are responsible for the most essential phenotypic characteristics of malignant transformation and progression. In this study, our aim was to estimate the prognostic effect of the established cancer hallmark genes in multiple distinct cancer types. RNA-seq HTSeq counts and survival data from 26 different tumor types were acquired from the TCGA repository. DESeq was used for normalization. Correlations between gene expression and survival were computed using the Cox proportional hazards regression and by plotting Kaplan–Meier survival plots. The false discovery rate was calculated to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. Signatures based on genes involved in genome instability and invasion reached significance in most individual cancer types. Thyroid and glioblastoma were independent of hallmark genes (61 and 54 genes significant, respectively), while renal clear cell cancer and low grade gliomas harbored the most prognostic changes (403 and 419 genes significant, respectively). The eight genes with the highest significance included BRCA1 (genome instability, HR 4.26, p {\textless} 1E−16), RUNX1 (sustaining proliferative signaling, HR 2.96, p = 3.1E−10) and SERPINE1 (inducing angiogenesis, HR 3.36, p = 1.5E−12) in low grade glioma, CDK1 (cell death resistance, HR = 5.67, p = 2.1E−10) in kidney papillary carcinoma, E2F1 (tumor suppressor, HR 0.38, p = 2.4E−05) and EREG (enabling replicative immortality, HR 3.23, p = 2.1E−07) in cervical cancer, FBP1 (deregulation of cellular energetics, HR 0.45, p = 2.8E−07) in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma and MYC (invasion and metastasis, HR 1.81, p = 5.8E−05) in bladder cancer. We observed unexpected heterogeneity and tissue specificity when correlating cancer hallmark genes and survival. These results will help to prioritize future targeted therapy development in different types of solid tumors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Dickkopf Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor (DKK) gene family, which is  known to inhibit the Wnt regulation process, is widely found in cancers. However, the roles and functions of specific family members in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are still unclear. MATERIAL AND METHODS Online bioinformatics tools (Oncomine, UALCAN, Kaplan-Meier plotter, GEPIA, Metascape, and STRING) were used to analyze the relationships between distinct DKKs and HNSCC. The transcriptome expression, clinical association, functions, pathways, and protein-protein interaction networks of DKKs in HNSCC were explored. RESULTS The mRNA expression of DKK1, DKK3, and Dickkopf-like acrosomal protein 1 (DKKL1) in HNSCC was significantly higher than in normal tissues, while that of DKK4 was lower. The mRNA expression of DKK1, DKK3, and DKKL1 was elevated in higher-grade HNSCC. The mRNA expression of DKK1 and DKK3 was elevated in human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative HNSCC, while DKKL1 had a higher mRNA expression in HPV-positive HNSCC. In addition, DKK1 was significantly associated with unfavorable overall survival in HNSCC patients. DKK3 was more likely to be a negative factor for the 5-year survival rate, while DKK4 was the opposite. DKK1 function was mainly enriched in GTPase-mediated signal transduction. Porcupine O-acyltransferase, a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway, was also associated with DKK1 in the protein-protein interaction network. CONCLUSIONS With regard to improving the therapeutic strategies of HNSCC in the future, DKK1 could be an unfavorable prognostic biomarker. DKK3, DKK4, and DKKL1 might be potential biomarkers for HNSCC.},

abstract = {Background. Obtaining adequate surgical margins, free of tumor, is crucial for success in oncologic surgery. The head and neck surgeon often finds that the tumor-free margin reported from histopathologic measurement is significantly smaller than the margin measured in-situ. It was the purpose of this study to quantify the change in size of mucosal and muscle surgical margins following excision, formalin fixation, and slide preparation of tongue and labiobuccal tissue in a canine model. Methods. Ten mongrel dogs under general anesthesia for a concurrent project were used in this study. Changes in mucosal and muscle dimensions around custom-made brass disks, one with a needle depth gauge, were measured immediately following excision after formalin fixation and after slide preparation. Results. The mean shrinkage from initial resection to final microscopic assessment of the lingual surface mucosal margins was 30.7{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). The deep tongue margin shrank 34.5{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). The mean shrinkage of the labiobuccal mucosal margin was 47.3{\%} (p {\textless} 0.0001). In all cases, the greatest proportion of shrinkage occurred immediately upon resection. Conclusions. From the in-situ measurement by the surgeon to final pathologic evaluation on the microscope slide, the measured dimensions of oral cavity mucosal and tongue muscle margins shrink significantly. To obtain 5 mm of pathologically clear margin an in-situ margin of resection of at least 8 to 10 mm needs to be taken. Studies reporting clinical correlation of recurrence and survival information with surgical margin status should include a detailed description of the technique used to determine the reported surgical margin status.},

abstract = {Background: Oral cancer is a worldwide problem. It is a universal aggressive disease in the population of smoking and drinking. The oral cancer mortality has been ranked 5th place in Taiwan in male cancer patients. A number of protein markers for oral cancer are still not applicable in large populations. Proteomic technologies provide excellent tools for rapid screening of a large number of potential biomarkers in malignant cells. Method: Proteomics and real-time quantitative RT-PCR were used to analyze over-expressed proteins in 10 OSCC patients. Result: Forty-one proteins were identified as commonly over-expressed in OSCC tissues. In OSCC tissues, $\alpha$B-crystallin, tropomyosin 2, myosin light chain 1, heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), stratifin, thioredoxin-dependent peroxide reductase, flavin reductase, vimentin, rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 2 (rho GDI-2), glutathione S-transferase Pi (GST-pi) and superoxide dismutase [Mn] (MnSOD) were significantly over-expressed (an average of 7.2, 6.0, 5.7, 4.3, 3.6, 3.4, 3.0, 3.0, 2.6, 2.5, 2.1-fold, respectively). In real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis, the gene expressions of $\alpha$B-crystallin, HSP27 and MnSOD were also increased in the cancer tissues, consistent with proteomic results. Conclusion: The identified proteins in this experiment may be used in future studies of carcinogenesis or as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for OSCC. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand the association of HPV infection and  wnt-$\beta$-catenin self-renewal pathway in development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). For this reason, the molecular profiles (methylation/deletion/expression) of antagonists (SFRP1/2 and DKK1), agonists (FZD7 and LRP6) and effector protein $\beta$-catenin of the pathway were analyzed in HPV positive/negative oral epithelium at first, followed by its changes during development of the tumor along with correlations with different clinico-pathological parameters. HPV infection alone or in combination with tobacco habit could activate p- $\beta$-catenin expression in basal/parabasal layers of oral epithelium through high expression of FZD7 and significant down regulation of SFRP1/2 through promoter hypermethylation due to over expression of DNMT1 with ubiquitous down regulation of DKK1 and up-regulation of LRP6. This phenomenon has been seen in respective HPV positive and negative HNSCC tumors with additional deletion/microsatellite size alterations in the antagonists. Overall alterations (methylation/deletion) of SFRP1/2, DKK1 gradually increased from Group I (HPV-/Tobacco-) to Group IV(HPV+/Tobacco+) tumors, leading to the worst prognosis of the patients. Thus, the transmission of differentially activated wnt-$\beta$-catenin pathway from HPV positive/negative basal/parabasal layers of oral epithelium to HNSCC tumors determines differences in molecular pathogenesis of the disease.},

abstract = {Feature selection is demanded in many modern scientific research problems that use high-dimensional data. A typical example is to identify gene signatures that are related to a certain disease from high-dimensional gene expression data. The expression of genes may have grouping structures, for example, a group of co-regulated genes that have similar biological functions tend to have similar expressions. Thus it is preferable to take the grouping structure into consideration to select features. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian Robit regression method with Hyper-LASSO priors (shortened by BayesHL) for feature selection in high dimensional genomic data with grouping structure. The main features of BayesHL include that it discards more aggressively unrelated features than LASSO, and it makes feature selection within groups automatically without a pre-specified grouping structure. We apply BayesHL in gene expression analysis to identify subsets of genes that contribute to the 5-year survival outcome of endometrial cancer (EC) patients. Results show that BayesHL outperforms alternative methods (including LASSO, group LASSO, supervised group LASSO, penalized logistic regression, random forest, neural network, XGBoost and knockoff) in terms of predictive power, sparsity and the ability to uncover grouping structure, and provides insight into the mechanisms of multiple genetic pathways leading to differentiated EC survival outcome.},

abstract = {Objective: To discuss the current available techniques for intraoperative margin assessment in the surgical treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) through a review of the available literature. Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of the available English literature between 2008 through 2018 regarding surgical margins in OCSS. A total of 893 relevant articles were returned; 144 met criteria for review; and 64 articles were included. Results: In this review, we discuss the data surrounding the use of frozen section in OCSS. Additionally, alternative techniques for margin assessment are discussed, including Mohs, molecular analysis, nonfluorescent dyes, fluorescent dyes, autofluorescent imaging, narrow-band imaging, optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, high-resolution microendoscopy, and spectroscopy. For each technique, particular emphasis is placed on the local recurrence, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates when available. Conclusion: This review provides support for the practice of specimen-driven margin assessment when using frozen section analysis to improve the utility of the results. Finally, several alternatives for intraoperative margin assessment currently under investigation, including pathologic, wide-field imaging and narrow-field imaging techniques, are presented. We aim to fuel further investigation into methods for margin assessment that will improve survival for patients with OSCC through a critical analysis of the available techniques.

For exam- ple, in genomic research, we want to find the genes that can be used to separate tissues of different classes (e.g. cancer and nor- mal). One approach is to fit regression/classification models with certain penalization. In the past decade, hyper-LASSO penalization (priors) have received increasing attention in the literature. However, fully Bayesian methods that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for regression/classification with hyper-LASSO priors are still in lack of development. In this paper, we introduce an MCMC method for learning multinomial logistic regression with hyper-LASSO priors. Our MCMC algorithm uses Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in a restricted Gibbs sampling framework. We have used simulation studies and real data to demonstrate the superior performance of hyper-LASSO pri- ors compared to LASSO, and to investigate the issues of choosing heaviness and scale of hyper-LASSO priors.},

However, the underlying mechanisms are still understood poorly. Here, we report that miR-873 promotes Warburg effect in HCC cells by increasing glucose uptake, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), lactate production, and ATP generation, and decreasing oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we show that miR-873 activates the key glycolytic proteins AKT/mTOR via targeting NDFIP1 which triggers metabolic shift. We further demonstrate that enhanced glycolysis is essential for the role of miR-873 to drive HCC progression. By using immunohistochemistry analysis, we show a link between the aberrant expression of miR-873, NDFIP1, and phospho-AKT in clinical HCC samples. We also found that miR-873 was up-regulated by HIF1$\alpha$, a critical glycolysis-related transcription factor. However, BAY 87-2243, a HIF1$\alpha$ specific inhibitor, blocks miR-873 mediated tumor growth and metastasis in nude mice. Collectively, our data uncover a previously unappreciated function of miR-873 in HCC cell metabolism and tumorigenesis, suggesting that targeting miR-873/NDFIP1 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC patients.},

abstract = {Abstract Background Resecting oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with an appropriate margin of uninvolved tissue is critical in preventing local recurrence and in making decisions regarding postoperative radiation therapy. This task can be difficult due to the discrepancy between margins measured intraoperatively and those measured microscopically by the pathologist after specimen processing. Material and methods A total of 61 patients underwent resective surgery with curative intent for primary oral SCC were included in this study. All patients underwent resection of the tumor with a measured 1-cm margin. Specimens were then submitted for processing and reviewing, and histopathologic margins were measured. The closest histopathologic margin was compared with the in situ margin (1 cm) to determine the percentage discrepancy. Results The mean discrepancy between the in situ margins and the histopathological margins of all close and positive margins were 47.6{\%} for the buccal mucosa (with a P value corresponding to 0.05 equaling 2.1), which is statistically significant, 4.8{\%} for the floor of mouth, 9.5{\%} for the mandibular alveolus, 4.8{\%} for the retromolar trigon, and 33.3{\%} for the tongue. Conclusion There is a significant difference among resection margins based on tumor anatomical location. Margins shrinkage after resection and processing should be considered at the time of the initial resection. Tumors located in the buccal mucosa show significantly greater discrepancies than tumors at other sites. These findings suggest that it is critical to consider the oral site when outlining margins to ensure adequacy of resection. Buccal SCC is an aggressive disease, and should be considered as an aggressive subsite within the oral cavity, requiring a radical and aggressive resective approach.},

abstract = {Synthetic lethality (SL) is a type of genetic interaction between two genes such that simultaneous perturbations of the two genes result in cell death or a dramatic decrease of cell viability, while a perturbation of either gene alone is not lethal. SL reflects the biologically endogenous difference between cancer cells and normal cells, and thus the inhibition of SL partners of genes with cancer-specific mutations could selectively kill cancer cells but spare normal cells. Therefore, SL is emerging as a promising anticancer strategy that could potentially overcome the drawbacks of traditional chemotherapies by reducing severe side effects. Researchers have developed experimental technologies and computational prediction methods to identify SL gene pairs on human and a few model species. However, there has not been a comprehensive database dedicated to collecting SL pairs and related knowledge. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive database, Syn-LethDB (http://histone.sce.ntu.edu.sg/SynLethDB/), which contains SL pairs collected from biochemical assays, other related databases, computational predictions and text mining results on human and four model species, i.e. mouse, fruit fly, worm and yeast. For each SL pair, a confidence score was calculated by integrating individual scores derived from different evidence sources. We also developed a statistical analysis module to estimate the druggability and sensitivity of cancer cells upon drug treatments targeting human SL partners, based on large-scale genomic data, gene expression profiles and drug sensitivity profiles on more than 1000 cancer cell lines. To help users access and mine the wealth of the data, we developed other practical functionalities, such as search and filtering, orthology search, gene set enrichment analysis. Furthermore, a user-friendly web interface has been implemented to facilitate data analysis and interpretation. With the integrated data sets and analytics functionalities, SynLethDB would be a useful resource for biomedical research community and pharmaceutical industry.},

abstract = {Objectives The resection status is one of the most important prognostic factors for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) concerning overall survival (OS) and recurrence free interval (RFI). To assess whether therapy concepts changed depending on different resection margins and extracapsular extension, OS and RFI data were set into clinical context. Methods All HNSCC patients who underwent head and neck surgery with/without adjuvant therapy (n=534) were selected over a ten-year period (2001-2011). Clinical parameters and survival data were collected retrospectively and histopathological analysis of tumor free margins and extracapsular extension were done. Results Patients with microscopic in-sano resection showed mean OS/RFI of 95/96 months. OS/RFI decreased in microscopic non-in-sano and macroscopic non-in-sano (56/58 and 35/39 months) as well as in unclear resection margins (63/60 months). Patients with extracapsular extension, microscopic non-in-sano resection as well as patients with in-sano resection after follow up resection demonstrated therapy escalation by adjuvant (chemo-) radiation. Conclusions Insufficient surgical margins and extracapsular extension are main risks for a reduced overall and recurrence free survival. Although there is no measure to prevent positive extracapsular extension, clear margins at first pass protect patients from adjuvant therapy escalation.},

abstract = {Human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is an independent  tumour type with regard to cellular, biological, and clinical features. The use of non-invasive biomarkers such as circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) may be relevant in early diagnosis and eventually improve the outcomes of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Genome-wide discovery using RNA sequencing and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing yielded 21 candidates for methylation-targeted genes. A verification study (252 HNSCC patients) using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (Q-MSP) identified 10 genes (ATP2A1, CALML5, DNAJC5G, GNMT, GPT, LY6D, LYNX1, MAL, MGC16275, and MRGPRF) that showed a significant increase recurrence in methylation groups with OPC. Further study on ctDNA using Q-MSP in HPV-associated OPC showed that three genes (CALML5, DNAJC5G, and LY6D) had a high predictive ability as emerging biomarkers for a validation set, each capable of discriminating between the plasma of the patients from healthy individuals. Among the 42 ctDNA samples, methylated CALML5, DNAJC5G, and LY6D were observed in 31 (73.8{\%}), 19 (45.2{\%}), and 19 (45.2{\%}) samples, respectively. Among pre-treatment ctDNA samples, methylated CALML5, DNAJC5G, and LY6D were observed in 8/8 (100{\%}), 7/8 (87.5{\%}), and 7/8 (87.5{\%}) samples, respectively. Methylated CALML5, DNAJC5G, and LY6D were found in 2/8 (25.0{\%}), 0/8 (0{\%}), and 1/8 (12.5{\%}) of the final samples in the series, respectively. Here, we present the relationship between the methylation status of three specific genes and cancer recurrence for risk classification of HPV-associated OPC cases. In conclusion, ctDNA analysis has the potential to aid in determining patient prognosis and real-time surveillance for disease recurrences and serves as an alternative method of screening for HPV-associated OPC.},

abstract = {Purpose: Accelerated repopulation is a main reason for locoregional failure after fractionated radiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a key controller of cellular proliferation in HNSCC, which stimulated the current study to look for a direct link between EGFR status and a possible clinical advantage of accelerated radiotherapy. Patients and Methods: Immunohistochemical staining for EGFR was performed in 304 patients with available pretreatment tumor biopsy material among 918 patients randomized to receive continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. The EGFR index was estimated as the proportion of tumor cells with EGFR membrane staining. Results: Significant benefit in locoregional tumor control from continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen in patients with HNSCC with high EGFR expression (2P = .010) but not in those with low EGFR expression (2P = .85). EGFR status had no significant effect on survival or rate of distant metastases. The EGFR index was significantly associated with histologic grade and microvessel density. There was moderate support for an association between EGFR status and subsite within the head and neck region but no significant association with Ki-67 index, Ki-67 pattern, p53 index, p53 intensity, bcl-2 expression, or cyclin D1 index. Conclusion: This study indicates a key role for the EGFR receptor in determining the proliferative cellular response to fractionated radiotherapy in HNSCC. It also shows that we can select the dose-fractionation regime that has the greatest chance of benefiting the patient. These results also encourage further development of EGFR targeting combined with fractionated radiotherapy in HNSCC. {\textcopyright} 2005 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Resection of the primary tumor with negative margins is the gold standard treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue (SCCOT). A microscopically positive surgical margin is clearly associated with a higher risk for local recurrence, whereas a negative margin has traditionally been defined as greater than 5.0mmclearance from the tumor, with lesser margins arbitrarily designated as close. The precise cutoff at which the risk for local recurrence with a close margin approximates that of a microscopically positive margin remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the arbitrarily defined close margin ({\textless}5.0 mm) would portend as high a risk for local recurrence as a positive margin after resection of SCCOT. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this retrospective study, head and neck pathologists reviewed archived tumor specimens from 381 patients with SCCOT who underwent primary surgical resection at a tertiary care center from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2012. Data were analyzed from November 15, 2015, to January 5, 2016. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used in patients who did not have a microscopically positive margin to determine an optimal margin cutoff for local recurrence-free survival (LRFS). Pathologic factors were assessed for LRFS in a multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end pointwas evaluation of the margin distance associated with LRFS. RESULTS Among the 381 patients included in the analysis (222 men [58.3{\%}] and 159 women [41.7{\%}]; mean [SD] age, 58 [14.7] years), the optimal cutoff associated with LRFS was determined to be 2.2 mm. This cutoff was compared with the traditionally accepted cutoff of 5.0 mm. Patients with a margin of 2.3 to 5.0mmhad similar LRFS as patients with a margin of greater than 5.0mm(hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95{\%}CI, 0.58-2.96), and all other comparisons were significantly different (HR for positive margin, 9.03; 95{\%}CI, 3.45-23.67; HR for 0.01- to 2.2-mm margin, 2.83; 95{\%}CI, 1.32-6.07). Based on this result, negative margins were redefined as those with a clearance of greater than 2.2 mm. In a multivariate model adjusting for pathologic factors, positive margins (adjusted HR, 5.73; 95{\%}CI, 2.45-13.41) and margins of 0.01 to 2.2mm(adjusted HR, 2.00; 95{\%}CI, 1.13-3.55) were the variables most significantly associated with LRFS. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, local recurrence-free survival was significantly affected only with surgical margins of less than or equal to 2.2mmin patients with SCCOT. This new definition of close margins stratifies the risk for local recurrence better than the arbitrary 5.0-mm cutoff that has been used.},

abstract = {Background: Controversy exists regarding the administration of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) when perineural invasion (PNI) is the only adverse histological feature. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of PNI on the survival of patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Methods: A retrospective study of 1524 treatment naive patients with oral cavity SCC who underwent surgery from January 2012 to March 2015 was conducted. Survival analysis was performed using Cox regression model. Results: The incidence of PNI was 20.3{\%} and higher in tongue cancers (odds ratio 2.43). The PNI significantly affected both disease-free survival (DFS; hazard ratio [HR] 1.84) as well as overall survival (OS; HR 1.7). Patients with early node-negative oral cavity SCC with PNI are more likely to develop recurrences and have mortality (HR 2.79 for DFS; HR 2.54 for OS). However, the addition of adjuvant radiation in these patients showed improvement in survival (p =.022). Forest plot analysis showed a trend toward poor survival across all subgroups in patients with PNI. Conclusion: Aggressive treatment of the primary cancer with the coincident management of the neck is important in the presence of PNI. The PNI worsens survival and warrants intensification of adjuvant treatment.},

We were interested if age, location, histological properties, or tumor recurrence depend on the BRAF status. SUBJECTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: We had 36 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded ameloblastoma tissue samples of patients treated at the Helsinki University Hospital between the years 1983-2016. Tissue sections underwent immunohistochemistry by Ventana BenchMark XT immunostainer using Ms Anti-Braf V600E (VE1) MAB. We used R 3.4.2 and RStudio 1.1.383 to conduct statistical analysis for BRAF positivity and earlier onset as well as tumor location. We used chi-squared tests and 2-by-2 table functions to determine connections between BRAF positivity and recurrence, growth pattern, and type. RESULTS: BRAF-positive tumors occurred in younger patients compared to BRAF-negative tumors (p = 0.015) and they located mostly to the mandible (p {\textless} 0.001). Growth patterns were limited to two in BRAF-negative tumors when BRAF-positive tumors presented with one to four growth patterns (p = 0.02). None of the maxillary tumors showed BRAF positivity and of these, 72.2{\%} recurred. CONCLUSIONS: An immunohistochemical BRAF marker could be a beneficial tool to predict the outcome of patients with this aggressive, easily recurring tumor.},

abstract = {Female breast cancer (BCa) is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an essential role in tumor invasion, angiogenesis, unlimited proliferation, and even immune escape, but we know little about the TME of BCa. In this study, we aimed to find a TME-related biomarker for BCa, especially for invasive breast carcinoma (BRCA), that could predict prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy. Based on RNA-seq transcriptome data and the clinical characteristics of 1222 samples (113 normal and 1109 tumor samples) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we used the ESTIMATE algorithm to calculate the ImmuneScore and StromalScore and then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the high and low ImmuneScore groups and the high and low StromalScore groups. Thereafter, a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and univariate Cox regression analyses of overall survival were used to identify potential key genes. Five candidate genes were identified, comprising CD2, CCL19, CD52, CD3E, and ITK. Thereafter, we focused on CD2, analyzing CD2 expression and its association with survival. CD2 expression was associated with tumor size (T stage) to some extent, but not with overall TNM stage, lymph node status (N stage), or distant metastasis (M stage). High CD2 expression was associated with longer survival. METABRIC data were used to validate the survival result (n = 276). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were significantly associated with high CD2 expression were mainly immune-related pathways. Furthermore, CD2 expression was correlated with 16 types of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs). Hence, CD2 might be a novel biomarker in terms of molecular typing, and it may serve as a complementary approach to TNM staging to improve clinical outcome prediction for BCa patients.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer (BRCA) has the highest incidence among female  malignancies, and the prognosis for these patients remains poor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, core modules and central genes related to BRCA were identified through a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene expression profiles and clinical data of GSE25066 were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The result was validated with RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine database. The top 30 key module genes with the highest intramodule connectivity were selected as the core genes (R(2) = 0.40). RESULTS: According to TCGA and Oncomine datasets, seven genes were selected as candidate hub genes. Following further experimental verification, four hub genes (FAM171A1, NDFIP1, SKP1, and REEP5) were retained. CONCLUSION: We identified four hub genes as candidate biomarkers for BRCA. These hub genes may provide a theoretical basis for targeted therapy against BRCA.},

abstract = {Heavy-tailed high-dimensional data are commonly encountered in various scientific fields and pose great challenges to modern statistical analysis. A natural procedure to address this problem is to use penalized quantile regression with weighted L 1 -penalty, called weighted robust Lasso (WR-Lasso), in which weights are introduced to ameliorate the bias problem induced by the L 1 -penalty. In the ultra-high dimensional setting, where the dimensionality can grow exponentially with the sample size, we investigate the model selection oracle property and establish the asymptotic normality of the WR-Lasso. We show that only mild conditions on the model error distribution are needed. Our theoretical results also reveal that adaptive choice of the weight vector is essential for the WR-Lasso to enjoy these nice asymptotic properties. To make the WR-Lasso practically feasible, we propose a two-step procedure, called adaptive robust Lasso (AR-Lasso), in which the weight vector in the second step is constructed based on the L 1 -penalized quantile regression estimate from the first step. This two-step procedure is justified theoretically to possess the oracle property and the asymptotic normality. Numerical studies demonstrate the favorable finite-sample performance of the AR-Lasso.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: DKK1 is an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway that has various roles in human physiology. Notably, aberrant DKK1 expression is observed in several cancers. In this retrospective study, we assessed the association between DKK1 expression levels and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using RNA-seq data from HNSCC tumors (N=520) and adjacent normal tissue (N=44) in The Cancer Genome Atlas, we evaluated DKK1 expression levels. Additionally, we evaluated the association of DKK1 expression levels and pathophysiological features of patients with HNSCC and the value of DKK1 expression for prediction of overall survival (OS). We also explored the correlation between DKK1 expression and methylation of its promoter in HNSCC. RESULTS: DKK1 expression was significantly upregulated in HNSCC compared with normal tissues. Moreover, DKK1 expression was significantly associated with smoking, alcohol abuse, sex, human papillomavirus status, tumor site, tumor invasion, and pathologic stage in HNSCC patients. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high DKK1 expression was correlated with inferior OS. In addition, univariate and multivariate analyses showed that elevated DKK1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for poor OS (HR: 1.85, 95{\%} CI: 1.31-2.62, P{\textless}0.001). Regression analysis identified a strong negative correlation between DKK1 expression and methylation of its promoter. CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that elevated DKK1 expression is modulated via methylation of its promoter and indicate that DKK1 expression is a highly informative prognostic biomarker for patients with HNSCC.},

abstract = {Background: This study investigated the diagnostic and prognostic values of kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) in breast cancer (BC) patients. Material/Methods: All data were obtained from the Cancer Genome Atlas. DESeq was run to test for differentially expressed KIF genes. Patients were divided into high-and low-expression groups according to the median expression values of each KIF genes. Survival data were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard model. Comprehensive survival analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of the prognostic signature. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to identify associated gene ontology and KEGG pathways. Results: Bioinformatics analysis showed that all KIF genes were significantly enriched during DNA replication and the cell cycle, and co-expressed with each other. Thirteen KIF genes were differentially expressed in cancer and adjacent tissues, and high levels of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A genes were significantly correlated with poor overall survival (OS). GSEA showed that BC patients with high expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were enriched in the cell cycle process, P53 regulation pathway and mismatch repair. Combinations of low expression of KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A were more highly correlated with favorable OS. Nomograms showed that the KIF4A risk score provided the maximum number of risk points (range 0–100), whereas other genes made a lower contribution. Conclusions: We conclude that 13 KIF genes are differentially expressed in BC tumor tissues, and KIF15, KIF20A, KIF23, KIF2C and KIF4A are associated with prognostic factors in BC.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE Positive margins are associated with poor prognosis among patients with oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). However, wide variation exists in the margin sampling technique. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of the margin sampling technique on local recurrence (LR) in patients with stage I or II oral tongue SCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective studywas conducted from January 1, 1986, to December 31, 2012, in 5 tertiary care centers following tumor resection and elective neck dissection in 280 patients with pathologic (p)T1-2 pN0 oral tongue SCC. Analysis was conducted from June 1, 2013, to January 20, 2015. INTERVENTIONS In group 1 (n = 119), tumor bed margins were not sampled. In group 2 (n = 61), margins were examined from the glossectomy specimen, found to be positive or suboptimal, and revised with additional tumor bed margins. In group 3 (n = 100), margins were primarily sampled from the tumor bed without preceding examination of the glossectomy specimen. The margin status (both as a binary [positive vs negative] and continuous [distance to the margin in millimeters] variable) and other clinicopathologic parameters were compared across the 3 groups and correlated with LR. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Local recurrence. RESULTS Age, sex, pT stage, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, and adjuvant radiation treatment were similar across the 3 groups. The probability of LR-free survival at 3 years was 0.9 and 0.8 in groups 1 and 3, respectively (P =.03). The frequency of positive glossectomy margins was lowest in group 1 (9 of 117 [7.7{\%}]) compared with groups 2 and 3 (28 of 61 [45.9{\%}] and 23 of 95 [24.2{\%}], respectively) (P {\textless}.001). Even after excluding cases with positive margins, the median distance to the closest margin was significantly narrower in group 3 (2 mm) compared with group 1 (3 mm) (P =.008). The status (positive vs negative) of margins obtained from the glossectomy specimen correlated with LR (P =.007), while the status of tumor bed margins did not. The status of the tumor bed margin was 24{\%}sensitive (95{\%}CI, 16{\%}-34{\%}) and 92{\%}specific (95{\%}CI, 85{\%}-97{\%}) for detecting a positive glossectomy margin. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The margin sampling technique affects local control in patients with oral tongue SCC. Reliance on margin sampling from the tumor bed is associated with worse local control, most likely owing to narrower margin clearance and greater incidence of positive margins. A resection specimen-based margin assessment is recommended.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In view of the critical role of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) in the pathogenesis of various diseases including cancer, this study aims to identify and evaluate the potential value of ARGs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: RNA sequencing and clinical data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were analyzed by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso Cox regression analysis model established a novel 13- autophagy related prognostic genes, which were used to build a prognostic risk model. A multivariate Cox proportional regression model and the survival analysis were used to evaluate the prognostic risk model. Moreover, the efficiency of prognostic risk model was tested by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis based on data from TCGA database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Besides, the other independent datasets from Human Protein Atlas dataset (HPA) also applied. RESULTS: 13 ARGs (GABARAPL1, ITGA3, USP10, ST13, MAPK9, PRKN, FADD, IKBKB, ITPR1, TP73, MAP2K7, CDKN2A, and EEF2K) with prognostic value were identified in HNSCC patients. Subsequently, a prognostic risk model was established based on 13 ARGs, and significantly stratified HNSCC patients into high- and low-risk groups in terms of overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.379，95{\%} CI: 0.289-0.495, p {\textless} 0.0001). The multivariate Cox analysis revealed that this model was an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.506, 95{\%} CI = 1.330-1.706, P {\textless} 0.001). The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) were significant for both the TCGA and GEO, with AUC of 0.685 and 0.928 respectively. Functional annotation revealed that model significantly enriched in many critical pathways correlated with tumorigenesis, including the p53 pathway, IL2 STAT5 signaling, TGF beta signaling, PI3K Ak mTOR signaling by gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In addition, we developed a nomogram shown some clinical net could be used as a reference for clinical decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we developed and validated a novel robust 13-gene signatures for HNSCC prognosis prediction. The 13 ARGs could serve as an independent and reliable prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the HNSCC patients.},

The successful identification of gene biomarkers will help in the classification of different types of cancer and improve the prediction accuracy. Recently, regularized logistic regression using the L1 regularization has been successfully applied in high-dimensional cancer classification to tackle both the estimation of gene coefficients and the simultaneous performance of gene selection. However, the L1 has a biased gene selection and dose not have the oracle property. To address these problems, we investigate L1/2 regularized logistic regression for gene selection in cancer classification.

abstract = {BACKGROUND. p53 and Ki-67 are regarded as potential interesting predictors of radioresistance, although their exact influence awaits confirmation on a large cohort of uniformly treated patients. METHODS. In a retrospective cohort of 304 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated with radical radiotherapy, the expression levels of p53 and Ki-67 were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Local control and survival curves were generated for p53 and Ki-67 using the Kaplan-Meier method. The difference between curves was calculated in univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS. The overexpression of p53 was associated with local treatment failure (P = 0.01) but not with survival (P = 0.09). In a Cox analysis, p53 overexpression remained an independent predictor of local failure, with a relative risk of local failure of 1.5 (P = 0.05). Low proliferation (Ki-67 {\textless} 20{\%}) was a significant factor in local failure for patients with tumors of the oral cavity only (P = 0.01). Patients with both unfavorable immunohistochemical markers (p53 overexpression and low proliferation) had a 45{\%} rate of local control compared with a 67{\%} rate for all other combinations (P = 0.002). This association was even more significant in patients with T1-T2 lesions (45{\%} vs. 77{\%}; P = 0.0002). CONCLUSIONS. The results support the role of p53 as an independent predictor of local failure in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck who are treated by radical radiotherapy, suggesting that it may predict radioresistance. Combined with p53, Ki-67 may help in the better selection of patients for radiotherapy, especially for patients with early-stage tumors. Prospective studies are now needed to confirm these results and to define better the role of these markers in the management of patients with head and neck carcinoma. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Cancer Society.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a dismal prognosis. Nearly 10 years after the approval of cetuximab, anti-PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors are the first drugs that have shown any survival benefit for the treatment on platinum-refractory recurrent/metastatic (R/M) HNSCC. Furthermore, checkpoint inhibitors are better tolerated than chemotherapy. The state of the art in the treatment of R/M HNSCC is changing, thanks to improved results for checkpoint inhibitors. Results for these treatments are also awaited in curative settings and for locally advanced HNSCC. Unfortunately, the response rate of immunotherapy is low. Therefore, the identification of predictive biomarkers of response and resistance to anti-PD1/PD-L1 is a key point for better selecting patients that would benefit the most from immunotherapy. Furthermore, the combination of checkpoint inhibitors with various agents is being currently evaluated to improve the response rate, prolong response duration, and even increase the chances for a cure. In this review, we summarize the most important results regarding immune targeting agents for HNSCC, predictive biomarkers for resistance to immune therapies, and future perspectives.},

The oncogene CCND1 is located at 11q13 and encodes cyclin D1, a cell cycle-regulating protein. The authors investigated the clinical relevance and associations between amplification and overexpression of cyclin D1 and 11q13 rearrangements. METHODS: The study involved two series of patients. In Series 1, overexpression of cyclin D1 and 11q13 rearrangements, assessed by immunohistochemistry and cytogenetics, respectively, were compared with clinical data in 75 patients with SCCHN. Patients were monitored for at least 18 months or until death. In another 23 patients (Series 2), the authors investigated the association between DNA amplification (by slot blot hybridization), overexpression of cyclin D1, and cytogenetics. RESULTS: In Series 1, 9 of 75 tumors (12{\%}) had 11q13 aberrations, 6 of which manifested elevated expression of cyclin D1. Patients with tumors strongly positive for cyclin D1 (n = 9) and those with tumors showing 11q13 rearrangements had poorer survival (P = 0.047 and 0.005, respectively). However, the correlation between these two variables was weak (P = 0.12). In Series 2, 17 of 23 tumors (74{\%}) showed elevated cyclin D1 protein expression, and 6 of these showed gene amplification as well. Of these six, only one revealed 11q13 rearrangements. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of cyclin D1 and 11q13 rearrangements are independent prognostic factors for SCCHN. In general, DNA amplification results in overexpression of cyclin D1, but additional genetic mechanisms are involved in the deregulation. Furthermore, oncogenes at 11q13 besides CCND1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Members of paraneoplastic Ma (PNMA) family have been identified as  onconeuronal antigens, which aberrant expressions in cancer cells of patients with paraneoplastic disorder (PND) are closely linked to manifestation of auto-immunity, neuro-degeneration, and cancer. The purpose of present study was to determine the role of PNMA5 and its functional relationship to MOAP-1 (PNMA4) in human cancer cells. METHODS: PNMA5 mutants were generated through deletion or site-directed mutagenesis and transiently expressed in human cancer cell lines to investigate their role in apoptosis, subcellular localization, and potential interaction with MOAP-1 through apoptosis assays, fluorescence microscopy, and co-immunoprecipitation studies, respectively. RESULTS: Over-expressed human PNMA5 exhibited nuclear localization pattern in both MCF-7 and HeLa cells. Deletion mapping and mutagenesis studies showed that C-terminus of PNMA5 is responsible for nuclear localization, while the amino acid residues (391KRRR) within the C-terminus of PNMA5 are required for nuclear targeting. Deletion mapping and co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that PNMA5 interacts with MOAP-1 and N-terminal domain of PNMA5 is required for interaction with MOAP-1. Furthermore, co-expression of PNMA5 and MOAP-1 in MCF-7 cells significantly enhanced chemo-sensitivity of MCF-7 to Etoposide treatment, indicating that PNMA5 and MOAP-1 interact synergistically to promote apoptotic signaling in MCF-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that PNMA5 promotes apoptosis signaling in HeLa and MCF-7 cells and interacts synergistically with MOAP-1 through its N-terminal domain to promote apoptosis and chemo-sensitivity in human cancer cells. The C-terminal domain of PNMA5 is required for nuclear localization; however, both N-and C-terminal domains of PNMA5 appear to be required for pro-apoptotic function.},

abstract = {Objective: miR-381 is implicated in the occurrence and development of various cancers, yet its role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains largely unknown. This study sought to research the direct target of miR-381 in HNSCC and investigate their roles in cancer progression. Methods: miRNA and mRNA expression files of HNSCC were accessed from TCGA database and then processed for differential analysis. Bioinformatics databases were employed to predict the target mRNAs of the potential miRNA. qRT-PCR was conducted to determine the expression levels of the target miRNA and mRNA. Then, a series of in vitro experiments like CCK-8, colony formation assay, wound healing assay and transwell assay were performed to detect cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was carried out for the further validation of the targeted relationship between the miRNA and mRNA. Results: miR-381 was observed to be greatly down-regulated in HNSCC cells, and its overexpression could inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Besides, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that STC2 was a direct target of miR-381, and their expression levels were reversely correlated. Moreover, rescue experiments demon-strated that overexpressing STC2 could rescue the inhibitory effect of miR-381 overexpres-sion on cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Also, we verified that miR-381/STC2 exerted its function on HNSCC proliferation by mediating the FAK/PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusion: miR-381 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in HNSCC through targeting STC2, and participates in HNSCC development probably via the FAK/ PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: About 15{\%} of men experience prostate specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy. A DNA methylation based molecular test could provide important information to predict which patients are most likely to experience recurrence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a genome-wide scan to find aberrantly methylated loci in prostate cancer from patients with early recurrence, high Gleason score or advanced stage. We discovered 441 candidate methylation markers and further analyzed 62 candidates in a methylation microarray study of 304 frozen prostatectomy samples. RESULTS: Methylation of 25 markers was significantly changed in high Gleason score (8-10) vs low Gleason score (2-6) cancers. Methylation levels of the 3 marker candidates GPR7, ABHD9 and an expressed sequence tag on chromosome 3 (Chr3-EST) were significantly increased in patients who did vs did not experience early PSA recurrence (Bonferroni correction p{\textless}0.05). Furthermore, these markers were also informative when the sample set was restricted to 68 mid range Gleason score (6 or 7) samples only. We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for ABHD9 and Chr3-EST, and measured methylation in paraffin embedded, formalin fixed prostatectomy samples from an independent set of 223 patients. Methylation of the 2 markers was significantly higher in patients with early PSA recurrence compared to that in patients who did not experience PSA recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: We report that methylation of the 3 novel markers GPR7, ABHD9 and Chr3-EST is significantly associated with prostate cancer prognosis. Incorporation of these methylation markers into clinical practice will result in more accurate prediction of which patients are likely to experience PSA recurrence.},

The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanism of cross-resistance to antitumor drugs containing a platinum agent in H-1R cells. The 3-(3, 4-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and clonogenecity assay indicated that H-1R cells showed strong cross-resistance to carboplatin, nedaplatin and oxaliplatin. The expression status of the copper transporter and organic cation transporters was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The transporters ATP7A, ATP7B, hCtr1, hOCT1 and hOCT2 were up-regulated, whereas hOCT3 was down-regulated. The cellular glutathione level was elevated 2-fold in H-1R cells compared with H-1 cells. Our results suggested that H-1 and H-1R cells may be useful in searching for candidate genes responsible for cross-resistance to platinum derivatives and for further studies to understand the mechanism of platinum resistance.},

Because hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1$\alpha$ plays an essential role in oxygen homeostasis in vitro, we explored the predictive potential of this factor in a cohort of 98 patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx, who were treated by curative radiation therapy. Ninety-four {\%} of the primary tumors showed overexpression of HIF-1$\alpha$, relative to the surrounding tissue, as determined by immunohistochemistry. The degree of HIF-1$\alpha$ immunoreactivity correlated inversely with both the rate of complete remission of the primary tumor (odds ratio, 0.33; P = 0.03) and lymph node metastases (odds ratio, 0.34; P = 0.02) as well as with local failure-free survival (risk ratio, 2.15; P = 0.006), disease-free survival (risk ratio, 2.01; P = 0.008), and overall survival (risk ratio, 2.17; P = 0.002). The multivariate analysis revealed the predictive power of HIF-1$\alpha$ to be independent of other covariables. We conclude that HIF-1$\alpha$ is overexpressed in the vast majority of patients with squamous cell cancer of the oropharynx and that the degree of expression has predictive and prognostic significance in individuals undergoing curative radiation therapy.},

abstract = {Cetuximab remains to date the only targeted therapy approved for the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The EGFR pathway plays a key role in the tumorigenesis and progression of this disease as well as in the resistance to radiotherapy (RT). While several anti-EGFR agents have been tested in HNSCC, cetuximab, an IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody against EGFR, is the only drug with proven efficacy for the treatment of both locoregionally-advanced (LA) and recurrent/metastatic (R/M) disease. The addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy is a validated treatment option in LA-HNSCC. However, its use has been limited to patients who are considered unfit for standard of care chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with single agent cisplatin given the lack of direct comparison of these two regimens in randomized phase III trials and the inferiority suggested by metanalysis and phase II studies. The current use of cetuximab in HNSCC is about to change given the recent results from randomized prospective clinical trials in both the LA and R/M setting. Two phase III studies evaluating RT-cetuximab vs. CRT in Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-positive LA oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (De-ESCALaTE and RTOG 1016) showed inferior overall survival and progression-free survival for RT-cetuximab combination, and therefore CRT with cisplatin remains the standard of care in this disease. In the R/M HNSCC, the EXTREME regimen has been the standard of care as first-line treatment for the past 10 years. However, the results from the KEYNOTE-048 study will likely position the anti-PD-1 agent pembrolizumab as the new first line treatment either alone or in combination with chemotherapy in this setting based on PD-L1 status. Interestingly, cetuximab-mediated immunogenicity through antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) has encouraged the evaluation of combined approaches with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in both LA and R/M-HNSCC settings. This article reviews the accumulated evidence on the role of cetuximab in HNSCC in the past decade, offering an overview of its current impact in the treatment of LA and R/M-HNSCC disease and its potential use in the era of immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Background/Aims: Emerging evidence suggests that the propagation of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is influenced by the abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). This study aimed to characterize the involvement of miR-182-5p in OSCC by targeting the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor CAMK2N1. Methods: miR-182-5p expression was quantified in OSCC tissues and cell lines with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Cell colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Ki-67, and nude mouse xenograft assays were used to characterize the role of miR-182-5p in the proliferation of OSCC. A miR-182-5p target gene was identified with western blotting, RT-PCR, and luciferase activity assays. OSCC patient survival based on CAMK2N1 expression was also analyzed. Results: miR-182-5p was up-regulated in in vitro cell lines and in vivo clinical OSCC samples. CCK-8, colony formation, and Ki-67 assays revealed that miR-182-5p promoted the growth and proliferation of OSCC cells. miR-182-5p directly targeted CAMK2N1, as evidenced by luciferase assays and target prediction algorithms. CAMK2N1 operated as a tumor suppressor gene in patients with OSCC. Down-regulating miR-182-5p expression in the CAL-27 cell line restored CAMK2N1-mediated OSCC cell proliferation. miR-182-5p expression inhibited the activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and NF-$\kappa$B. Mice injected with CAL-27 cells transfected with miR-182-5p-inhibitor demonstrated a significant increase in tumor size and weight and increased CAMK2N1 mRNA and protein expression compared with the miR-negative control group. Conclusion: The miR-182-5p-CAMK2N1 pathway can be potentially targeted to regulate the proliferation of OSCC cells.},

The hypotheses proposed examined whether microarray measurements of gene expression either alone or combined with basic clinical covariates (stage, age, sex) could be used to predict overall survival in lung cancer subjects. Several models examined produced risk scores that substantially correlated with actual subject outcome.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional influenza surveillance relies on influenza-like illness (ILI) syndrome that is reported by health care providers. It primarily captures individuals who seek medical care and misses those who do not. Recently, Web-based data sources have been studied for application to public health surveillance, as there is a growing number of people who search, post, and tweet about their illnesses before seeking medical care. Existing research has shown some promise of using data from Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia to complement traditional surveillance for ILI. However, past studies have evaluated these Web-based sources individually or dually without comparing all 3 of them, and it would be beneficial to know which of the Web-based sources performs best in order to be considered to complement traditional methods. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to comparatively analyze Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia by examining which best corresponds with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ILI data. It was hypothesized that Wikipedia will best correspond with CDC ILI data as previous research found it to be least influenced by high media coverage in comparison with Google and Twitter. METHODS: Publicly available, deidentified data were collected from the CDC, Google Flu Trends, HealthTweets, and Wikipedia for the 2012-2015 influenza seasons. Bayesian change point analysis was used to detect seasonal changes, or change points, in each of the data sources. Change points in Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia that occurred during the exact week, 1 preceding week, or 1 week after the CDC's change points were compared with the CDC data as the gold standard. All analyses were conducted using the R package "bcp" version 4.0.0 in RStudio version 0.99.484 (RStudio Inc). In addition, sensitivity and positive predictive values (PPV) were calculated for Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia. RESULTS: During the 2012-2015 influenza seasons, a high sensitivity of 92{\%} was found for Google, whereas the PPV for Google was 85{\%}. A low sensitivity of 50{\%} was calculated for Twitter; a low PPV of 43{\%} was found for Twitter also. Wikipedia had the lowest sensitivity of 33{\%} and lowest PPV of 40{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3 Web-based sources, Google had the best combination of sensitivity and PPV in detecting Bayesian change points in influenza-related data streams. Findings demonstrated that change points in Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia data occasionally aligned well with change points captured in CDC ILI data, yet these sources did not detect all changes in CDC data and should be further studied and developed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.},

abstract = {This phase 1b, open-label trial assessed the combination of afatinib, an ErbB family blocker, with cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, in heavily pretreated patients with unselected/EGFR wild-type, advanced solid tumours. In Part A, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of afatinib + cetuximab was evaluated using a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design; the starting dose was afatinib 30 mg/day plus cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week (after cetuximab 400 mg/m2 loading dose), escalating to afatinib 40 mg/day. Part B further evaluated safety and tolerability at the MTD and preliminary anti-tumour activity in three patient cohorts with squamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and other solid tumours. Nine patients were treated in Part A; the MTD and recommended dose was determined as afatinib 40 mg/day plus cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week. In Part B, 49 patients were treated at the recommended dose (12 with squamous NSCLC, 15 with HNSCC and 22 with other tumours). The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) across all 58 patients were diarrhoea (63.8{\%}) and acneiform dermatitis (43.1{\%}). Overall, the best confirmed response was stable disease (SD; 53.4{\%}); mean duration of disease control was 4.5 months; median progression-free survival was 2.6 months. In Part B, 55.1{\%} of patients had SD (squamous NSCLC, 75.0{\%}; HNSCC, 66.7{\%}; other tumours; 36.4{\%}). In conclusion, the recommended phase 2 dose was determined as afatinib 40 mg/day plus cetuximab 250 mg/m2/week. AEs were predictable and manageable, and anti-tumour activity was observed in some patients, particularly in those with squamous NSCLC and HNSCC.

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: An estimated 4{\%} to 7{\%} of the population will develop a clinically significant thyroid nodule during their lifetime. In many cases, preoperative diagnoses by needle biopsy are inconclusive. Thus, there is a clear need for improved diagnostic tests to distinguish malignant from benign thyroid tumors. The recent development of high-throughput molecular analytic techniques should allow the rapid evaluation of new diagnostic markers. However, researchers are faced with an overwhelming number of potential markers from numerous thyroid cancer expression profiling studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To address this challenge, we have carried out a comprehensive meta-review of thyroid cancer biomarkers from 21 published studies. A gene ranking system that considers the number of comparisons in agreement, total number of samples, average fold-change and direction of change was devised. RESULTS: We have observed that genes are consistently reported by multiple studies at a highly significant rate (P {\textless} .05). Comparison with a meta-analysis of studies reprocessed from raw data showed strong concordance with our method. CONCLUSION: Our approach represents a useful method for identifying consistent gene expression markers when raw data are unavailable. A review of the top 12 candidates revealed well known thyroid cancer markers such as MET, TFF3, SERPINA1, TIMP1, FN1, and TPO as well as relatively novel or uncharacterized genes such as TGFA, QPCT, CRABP1, FCGBP, EPS8 and PROS1. These candidates should help to develop a panel of markers with sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of thyroid tumors in a clinical setting.},

An appropriate string was run on PubMed to retrieve articles discussing the 'close' surgical margin issue in HNSCC. A double cross-check was performed on citations and full-text articles retrieved. In total, 348 articles were identified. Further references were included by using the option "Titles in your search terms" option in PubMed. 15 papers were finally included for qualitative synthesis. In vocal cord surgery of HNSCC, a close margin could be considered to be ≤1 mm, in the larynx ≤5 mm, in the oral cavity ≤4 mm, and in the oropharynx ≤5 mm. In each patient, the choice of extent of close margin should be balanced against general condition, tumor stage, and functional issues to indicate appropriate adjuvant therapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The development of high-throughput gene expression assays in the last two decades has provided the invaluable opportunity to improve our knowledge on cancer biology and to identify predictive signatures in the most deeply analyzed malignancies, such as hematological and breast cancers. At variance, till 2010, the number of reliable reports referring gene expression data related to HSNCC biology and prediction was quite limited. A critical revision of the literature reporting gene expression data in HNSCC indicated that in the last 6 years, there were new important studies with a relevant increase in the sample size and a more accurate selection of cases, the publication of a growing number of studies applying a computational integration (meta-analysis) of different microarray datasets addressing similar clinical/biological questions, the increased use of molecular sub-classification of tumors according to their gene expression, and the release of the publicly available largest dataset in HNSCC by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) consortium. Overall, also for this disease, it become evident that the expression analysis of the entire transcriptome has been enabling to achieve the identification of promising molecular signatures for (i) disclosure of the biology behind carcinogenesis with special focus on the HPV-related one, (ii) prediction of tumor recurrence or metastasis development, (iii) identification of subgroups of tumors with different biology and associated prognosis, and (iv) prediction of outcome and/or response to therapy. The increasing awareness of the relevance of strict collaboration among clinicians and translational researchers would in a near future enable the application of a personalized HNSCCs patients' treatment in the clinical practice based also on gene expression signatures.},

abstract = {Purpose: Cetuximab, an antibody directed against the EGF receptor, is an effective clinical therapy for patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Despite great clinical promise, intrinsic or acquired cetuximab resistance hinders successful treatment outcomes but little is known about the underlying mechanism. Experimental Design: To study the role of oncogenic HRAS in cetuximab resistance in HNSCC, the frequency of oncogenic HRAS mutations was determined in a cohort of 180 genomic DNAs from head and neck cancer specimens. Wealso used a combination of cetuximab-resistant cell lines and a transgenic mouse model of RAS-driven oral cancer to identify an oncogenic RAS-specific gene expression signature that promotes cetuximab resistance. Results: Here, we show that activation of RAS signaling leads to persistent extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling and consequently to cetuximab resistance. HRAS depletion in cells containing oncogenic HRAS or PIK3CA restored cetuximab sensitivity. In our study, the gene expression signature of c-MYC, BCL-2, BCL-XL, and cyclin D1 upon activation of MAPK signaling was not altered by cetuximab treatment, suggesting that this signature may have a pivotal role in cetuximab resistance of RAS-activated HNSCC. Finally, a subset of patients with head and neck cancer with oncogenic HRAS mutations was found to exhibit de novo resistance to cetuximab-based therapy. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings identify a distinct cetuximab resistance mechanism. Oncogenic HRAS in HNSCC promotes activation of ERK signaling, which in turn mediates cetuximab resistance through a specific gene expression signature. {\textcopyright}2014 AACR.},

abstract = {The prognosis of most cancers has been improved in recent years due to the increased survival of cancer patients, the prolonged lifespan of the general population, and better diagnostic and surgical approaches. Subsequently, the number of patients with multiple primary carcinomas (MPCs) has become greater. In this report, we describe a unique case of a 71-year-old man with five metachronous and synchronous primary malignant tumors. The patient was first diagnosed with synchronous, left posterior tonsillar pillar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and right lingual surface of epiglottis SCC in June 2016. Two years later, he presented with three other primary carcinomas within a 3-month time span: right lower lobe lung SCC, right tongue invasive SCC and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), consecutively. Investigations revealed no metastases of the primary neoplasms. As the population of older adults with cancer and multimorbidity grows, the therapeutic options usually become limited. On the other hand, understanding the effect of multimorbidity on the care of patients with cancer and developing therapeutic interventions for these elderly patients would be crucial for geriatric care.

abstract = {A substantial body of research has investigated the associations between  stress-related psychosocial factors and cancer outcomes. Previous narrative reviews have been inconclusive. In this Review, we evaluated longitudinal associations between stress and cancer using meta-analytic methods. The results of 165 studies indicate that stress-related psychosocial factors are associated with higher cancer incidence in initially healthy populations (P = 0.005); in addition, poorer survival in patients with diagnosed cancer was noted in 330 studies (P {\textless}0.001), and higher cancer mortality was seen in 53 studies (P {\textless}0.001). Subgroup meta-analyses demonstrate that stressful life experiences are related to poorer cancer survival and higher mortality but not to an increased incidence. Stress-prone personality or unfavorable coping styles and negative emotional responses or poor quality of life were related to higher cancer incidence, poorer cancer survival and higher cancer mortality. Site-specific analyses indicate that psychosocial factors are associated with a higher incidence of lung cancer and poorer survival in patients with breast, lung, head and neck, hepatobiliary, and lymphoid or hematopoietic cancers. These analyses suggest that stress-related psychosocial factors have an adverse effect on cancer incidence and survival, although there is evidence of publication bias and results should be interpreted with caution.},

abstract = {Improved disease-free survival for oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with the use of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) has to be balanced against the risk of recurrence, the relative morbidity of radiotherapy, reduced options for treatment, and survival with recurrent disease. In the absence of randomised trials, a review of current evidence is timely because of increasing differences in outcome and response to treatment for cancers of the larynx, oropharynx, and oral cavity. From a search of 109 papers, 25 presented relevant data in tabular form, and reported local, regional, and total recurrence, and overall survival. Most data come from non-randomised studies that compared the effects of interventions with previous or historical information. A summary of the results shows local recurrence of 11{\%}, 17{\%}, and 15{\%} for early, late, and all stages after operation alone, compared with 13{\%}, 16{\%}, and 19{\%} after PORT. Regional recurrence is reported as 13{\%}, 12{\%}, and 11{\%} for early, late, and all stages after operation alone compared with 6{\%}, 11{\%}, and 9{\%} after PORT. Overall survival is reported as 76{\%}, 74{\%}, and 77{\%} for operation alone compared with 65{\%}, 62{\%}, and 62{\%} for early, late and all stages of oral SCC, respectively. It is acknowledged that this is a weak level of evidence as patients who have PORT probably have a high pathological-stage of disease. Knowing that PORT increases morbidity and reduces salvage rates and options for treating recurrent disease, this difference in overall survival emphasises the need for randomised studies or a re-evaluation of our current protocols. {\textcopyright} 2011 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: IL-19 is expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but its biological effect on esophageal cancer remains unclear. We determined the correlation between IL-19 expression levels and clinicopathological variables and explored the effects of IL-19 on the esophageal SCC in vivo and in vitro. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We determined the expression levels of esophageal SCC tissues from 60 patients using immunohistochemistry. We examined the effects of IL-19 on intracellular signaling, cytokines production as well as proliferation, colonization, and migration in the human esophageal SCC cell line CE81T. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against IL-19 (1BB1) and its receptor IL-20R1 (51D) were used to antagonize the effects of IL-19. We injected SCID mice with CE81T cells and then treated them with anti-IL-19 mAb or control IgG every 3 days and determined tumor growth for 32 days. Of the 60 esophageal SCC patients, 36 patients (60{\%}) were IL-19 strongly stained, which was associated with advanced tumor stage. CE81T cells expressed IL-19 and its receptors. IL-19 induced phosphorylation of STAT3, P38, JNK, ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-$\kappa$B in CE81T cells. IL-19 promoted the proliferation, colonization, and migration of CE81T cells, which were antagonized by 1BB1 and 51D. IL-19 also induced expression of the transcripts of TGF-$\beta$, cyclin B1, CXCR4, and MMP-1 in CE81T cells. In CE81T tumor-bearing mice, 1BB1 reduced tumor growth and downregulated TGF-$\beta$, cyclin B1, MMP-1, and CXCR4 expression in tumors. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: IL-19 affects the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer. IL-19 mAb (1BB1) is potentially a potent drug for esophageal cancer therapy.},

@article{Yamamoto2001,
abstract = {NF-$\kappa$B comprises a family of inducible transcription factors that serve as important regulators of the host immune and inflammatory response. In addition, NF-$\kappa$B is also involved in protecting cells from undergoing apoptosis in response to DNA damage or cytokine treatment. Stimulation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway is mediated by diverse signal transduction cascades. These signals activate the I$\kappa$B kinases, IKK$\alpha$ and IKK$\beta$, which phosphorylate inhibitory proteins known as I$\kappa$B to result in their ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome. The degradation of I$\kappa$B results in the translocation of NF-$\kappa$B from the cytoplasm to the nucleus where it activates the expression of specific cellular genes. As we better understand the regulation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway, the potential for inhibiting this pathway has received attention. Agents that inhibit this pathway, such as glucocorticoids and aspirin, can reduce the inflammatory response, while other agents such as dominant negative I$\kappa$B proteins potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the treatment of cancer. Here, we discuss cellular genes and disease states associated with activation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway and consider therapeutic strategies to prevent the prolonged activation of the NF-$\kappa$B pathway.},

Methods The approach in our investigation was through a retrospective review of patients treated with primary surgery, with frozen section margin control in oral carcinoma. Inclusion criteria included availability of frozen and permanent section histology reports of resection margins and negative final resection margins. Results Of 547 patients studied, 175 received adjuvant radiation. Local and regional control and disease‐specific survival rates were 81.6{\%}, 78.4{\%}, and 76.3{\%}, respectively. Tumor cut‐through and pathologic nodal (pN) stage had an independently adverse effect on local control. Tumor cut‐through adversely affected cancer control and survival, but this effect diminished significantly in the absence of regional disease. Conclusions Microscopic tumor cut‐through revised to negative margins is a powerful prognosticator that is observed only when regional disease is also present. The value of adjuvant therapeutic regimens is questionable in patients with microscopic tumor cut‐through, revised to negative margins, and with no regional disease. {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to determine the efficacy of MBSR in the treatment of chronic illnesses; it's mechanism of action and adverse effects. It describes an alternative method of treatment for physicians and patients that may help patients cope with their diseases in a more effective way. Materials and Methods: COCHRANE, EMBASE and MEDLINE were systematically searched for data on outcome of treatment with MBSR used alone or in conjunction with other treatments. The data available on prevention of diseases through MBSR was also analyzed. Results: All the 18 studies included in this systematic review showed improvement in the condition of patients after MBSR therapy. These studies were focused on patients with chronic diseases like cancer, hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain and skin disorders, before and after MBSR therapy. Conclusions: Although the research on MBSR is sparse, the results of these researches indicate that MBSR improves the condition of patients suffering from chronic illnesses and helps them cope with a wide variety of clinical problems.},

abstract = {There is broad interest to improve the reproducibility of published research. We developed a survey tool to assess the availability of digital research artifacts published alongside peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g. data, models, code, directions for use) and reproducibility of article results. We used the tool to assess 360 of the 1,989 articles published by six hydrology and water resources journals in 2017. Like studies from other fields, we reproduced results for only a small fraction of articles (1.6{\%} of tested articles) using their available artifacts. We estimated, with 95{\%} confidence, that results might be reproduced for only 0.6{\%} to6.8{\%} of all 1,989 articles. Unlike prior studies, the survey tool identified key bottlenecks to making work more reproducible. Bottlenecks include: only some digital artifacts available (44{\%} of articles), no directions (89{\%}), or all artifacts available but results not reproducible (5{\%}). The tool (or extensions) can help authors, journals, funders, and institutions to self-assess manuscripts, provide feedback to improve reproducibility, and recognize and reward reproducible articles as examples for others.},

abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains to be a challenging public health problem worldwide. However, the underlying molecular mechanism regulating the carcinogenesis of OSCC is poorly known. Gene expression profiles of GSE13601, GSE30784, GSE37991 and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) head and neck cancer were downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO) and TCGA database respectively. R software and bioconductor packages were used to compare and identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between OSCC tissues and normal controls. The common DEGs were then subjected to gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis as well as survival analysis. A total of 76 up- and 102 down-regulated DEGs were identified. Functional analysis revealed that these DEGs were associates with increased oncostatin M signaling, cell diapedesis and extravasation as well as reduced calcium signaling and loss of adherens junctions and tight junctions. A set of robust prognostic signatures including PLAU, CLDN8 and CDKN2A were identified from DEGs and could predict overall survival in OSCC patients from TCGA cohort. This three-gene signature was further successfully validated as a prognostic marker for overall survival prediction in another independent cohort GSE41613. In conclusion, our study has identified a registry of novel genes and pathways that play important roles in regulating the initiation and development of OSCC. A set of robust molecular signature is identified for prognostic prediction, which will provide useful guidance for therapeutic applications.},

abstract = {Fanconi anemia (FA) and dyskeratosis congenita (DC) are rare inherited syndromes that cause head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). Prior studies of inherited forms of cancer have been extremely important in elucidating tumor suppressor genes inactivated in sporadic tumors. Here, we studied whether sporadic tumors have epigenetic silencing of the genes causing the inherited forms of HNSCC. Using bisulfite sequencing, we investigated the incidence of promoter hypermethylation of the 17 Fanconi- and DC-associated genes in sporadic HNSCC. Genes that only showed methylation in the tumor patients were chosen for quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) in a set of 45 tumor and 16 normal patients. Three gene promoters showed differences in methylation: FancB (FAAP95, FA core complex), FancJ (BRIP1, DNA Helicase/ATPase), and DKC1 (dyskeratin). Bisulfite sequencing revealed that only FancB and DKC1 showed no methylation in normal patients, yet the presence of promoter hypermethylation in tumor patients. On qMSP, 1/16 (6.25{\%}) of the normal mucosal samples from non-cancer patients and 14/45 (31.1{\%}) of the tumor patients demonstrated hypermethylation of the FancB locus (p {\textless} 0.05). These results suggest that inactivation of FancB may play a role in the pathogenesis of sporadic HNSCC. {\textcopyright} 2010 S. Karger AG.},

abstract = {Cancer-causing herpesviruses infect nearly every human and persist indefinitely in B lymphocytes in a quiescent state known as latency. A hallmark of this quiescence or latency is the presence of extrachromosomal viral genomes with highly restricted expression of viral genes. Silencing of viral genes ensures both immune evasion by the virus and limited pathology to the host, yet how multiple genes on multiple copies of viral genomes are simultaneously silenced is a mystery. In a unifying theme, we report that both cancer-causing human herpesviruses, despite having evolved independently, are silenced through the activities of two members of the Kr{\"{u}}ppel-associated box (KRAB) domain–zinc finger protein (ZFP) (KRAB-ZFP) epigenetic silencing family, revealing a novel STAT3-KRAB-ZFP axis of virus latency. This dual-edged antiviral strategy restricts the destructive ability of the lytic phase while promoting the cancer-causing latent phase. These findings also unveil roles for KRAB-ZFPs in silencing of multicopy foreign genomes with the promise of evicting herpesviruses to kill viral cancers bearing clonal viral episomes. IMPORTANCE Despite robust immune responses, cancer-causing viruses Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) persist for life. This persistence is accomplished partly through a stealth mechanism that keeps extrachromosomal viral genomes quiescent. Quiescence, or latency, ensures that not every cell harboring viral genomes is killed directly through lytic activation or indirectly via the immune response, thereby evicting virus from host. For the host, quiescence limits pathology. Thus, both virus and host benefit from quiescence, yet how quiescence is maintained through silencing of a large set of viral genes on multiple viral genomes is not well understood. Our studies reveal that members of a gene-silencing family, the KRAB-ZFPs, promote quiescence of both cancer-causing human viruses through simultaneous silencing of multiple genes on multicopy extrachromosomal viral genomes.},

Figure 7 (F) Model of oncogenic human herpesvirus persistence depicting that STAT3 transcriptionally activates the KRAB-ZFPs SZF1 and ZNF557, which localize to EBV and KSHV genomes. Bound SZF1 functions directly through TRIM28 to repress lytic genes despite the presence of lytic triggers, while bound ZNF557 functions in a TRIM28-independent manner (?), thereby maintaining latency and promoting virus persistence.
Taken together, this evidence points to a key role for KRAB-ZFPs in regulating virus
infections by silencing multicopy extrachromosomal foreign DNA elements, particularly in the context of oncogenic herpesviruses that infect practically every human. By influencing the balance between quiescence and the lytic state, these repressors effect virus persistence in the host and the population. On the one hand, the STAT3-KRAB-ZFP pathway curbs pathology by restricting the lytic phase. On the other hand, since both EBV and KSHV B lymphomas are dominated by the latent/episomal state, this pathway may contribute to cancer development. Importantly, disrupting this pathway may boost oncolytic efforts to kill viral cancers by evicting herpesviruses.},

abstract = {Importance: The achievement of complete tumor resection with tumor-free margins is one of the main principles of oncologic surgery for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The negative prognostic influence of a positive margin (PM) across all head and neck subsites has been well established. National guidelines recommend the use of adjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) in the setting of PM. Objective: To determine the incidence of PM in HNSCC across multiple subsites, as well as the factors associated with its occurrence. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used the National Cancer Database to identify patients diagnosed with HNSCC between 2010 and 2014 and who underwent surgical resection (n = 28840). Main Outcomes and Measures: Predictors of PM rate and likelihood to receive adjuvant CRT. Results: Among the 28840 patients included in this study, 19727 (68.4 {\%}) were men, and the average age was 62.4 years (range, 40 to ≥90 years). In univariable analysis, a lower PM rate was associated with higher facility volume (26.3{\%} for the lowest volume quartile, 16.5{\%} for the middle 2 quartiles, and 10.8{\%} for the highest volume quartile) and treatment at academic vs nonacademic facilities (14.0{\%} vs 22.7{\%}). In multivariate analysis, those treated at higher-volume facilities remained significantly less likely to have PM (adjusted odds ratio, 0.85; 95{\%} CI, 0.83-0.88). The trend of decreasing PM rate with increasing facility volume was observed in both academic (aOR, 0.88 per 10-case volume increase [95{\%} CI, 0.85-0.91]) and nonacademic (aOR, 0.73 per 10-case volume increase [95{\%} CI, 0.68-0.80]) facilities. There was no association between facility volume and patient likelihood of receiving adjuvant CRT in the setting of PM (compared with CCPs: aOR, 0.98 per 10-case volume increase [95{\%} CI, 0.84-1.14] for CCCPs; and aOR, 1.24 [95{\%} CI, 0.99-1.55] for INCPs). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that high-volume facilities are associated with lower rates of PM in the surgical treatment of HNSCC in both academic and nonacademic settings. Facility volume for head and neck oncologic surgeries may be considered a benchmark for quality of care.},

There was no interaction between treatment effect and the following patient covariates: Age, sex, performance status, tumor stage, or site. Tax-PF was associated with significant reductions of progression, locoregional failure, and distant failure compared with PF, with HRs of 0.78 (95{\%} CI, 0.69 to 0.87; P {\textless} .001), 0.79 (95{\%} CI, 0.66 to 0.94; P = .007), and 0.63 (95{\%} CI, 0.45 to 0.89; P = .009) respectively. Conclusion This IPD meta-Analysis shows the superiority of Tax-PF over PF as induction chemotherapy. Its precise role in the management of LAHNC remains to be determined.},

abstract = {Objective This is a review of spiritually based interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction) that utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought to examine the evidence regarding relationships between spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Methods A systematic search of 9 online databases was conducted for articles of original research, peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer selected questions regarding relationships between psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized in spiritually based interventions. Implications for future spiritually based interventions in breast cancer survivorship are discussed. Results Twenty-two articles were reviewed. Cortisol was the most common PNI biomarker outcome studied. Compared with control groups, intervention groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although limitations exist. Design methods have improved with regard to increased use of comparison groups compared with previous reviews. There are few spiritually based interventions that specifically measure religious or spiritual constructs. Similarly, there are few existing studies that utilize standardized religious or spiritual measures with PNI outcome measures. Findings suggest that a body of knowledge now exists in support of interventions with mindfulness-breathing-stretching components; furthermore, these interventions appear to offer potential improvement or stabilization of neuroendocrine-immune activity in breast cancer survivors compared to control groups. Conclusion From a PNI perspective, future spiritually based interventions should include standardized measures of religiousness and spirituality in order to understand relationships between and among religiousness, spirituality, and neuroendocrine-immune outcomes. Future research should now focus on determining the minimum dose and duration needed to improve or stabilize neuroendocrine-immune function, as well as diverse setting needs, including home-based practice for survivors who are too ill to travel to group sessions or lack economic resources.},

We profiled transcriptomes of ∼6,000 single cells from 18 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, including five matched pairs of primary tumors and lymph node metastases. Stromal and immune cells had consistent expression programs across patients. Conversely, malignant cells varied within and between tumors in their expression of signatures related to cell cycle, stress, hypoxia, epithelial differentiation, and partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (p-EMT). Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features. Our results provide insight into the HNSCC ecosystem and define stromal interactions and a p-EMT program associated with metastasis. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma highlights the heterogeneous composition of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment and associates a partial EMT program with metastasis.},

abstract = {Conclusion Using an independent analytical platform, PITX2 methylation was validated as a prognostic biomarker in HNSCC patients, identifying patients that potentially benefit from intensified surveillance and/or administration of adjuvant/neodjuvant treatment, i.e. immunotherapy.Background Despite advances in combined modality therapy, outcomes in head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC) remain dismal with five-year overall survival rates of less than 50{\%}. Prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed to identify patients with a high risk of death after initial curative treatment. Methylation status of the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (PITX2) has recently emerged as a powerful prognostic biomarker in various cancers. In the present study, the clinical performance of PITX2 methylation was validated in a HNSCC cohort by means of an independent analytical platform (Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, Illumina, Inc.). Methods A total of 528 HNSCC patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were included in the study. Death was defined as primary endpoint. PITX2 methylation was correlated with overall survival and clinicopathological parameters. Results PITX2 methylation was significantly associated with sex, tumor site, p16 status, and grade. In univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, PITX2 hypermethylation analyzed as continuous and dichotomized variable was significantly associated with prolonged overall survival of HNSCC patients (continuous: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.19 [95{\%}CI: 0.04±0.88], p = 0.034; dichotomized: HR = 0.52 [95{\%}CI: 0.33±0.84], p = 0.007). In multivariate Cox analysis including established clinicopathological parameters, PITX2 promoter methylation was confirmed as prognostic factor (HR = 0.28 [95{\%}CI: 0.09±0.84], p = 0.023).},

abstract = {Background: More than 90{\%} of malignant tumors diagnosed in the oral cavity are Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas (OSCC) whose preferred location is the tongue. Classically, this disease has affected men preferentially, although recent studies suggest that trends are changing and the proportion of women with OSCC is increasing. In addition, the prevalence of oral cancer is also determined by some risk factors as alcohol consumption and tobacco. Currently, the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) classification is employed to defined tumor stage and based on this guide specific treatments are established. However, 5-year-survival does not exceed 50{\%} of cases. The objective of this study is to determine whether a histological risk pattern indicative of higher recurrence might be present in T1-T2 tumors located in the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Material and Methods: Samples from 26 patients with OSCC were analyzed and histological risk pattern of recurrent and non-recurrent tumors were compared. We have analyzed histological variables described in Anneroth and Brandwein-Gensler classifications. Additionally, we have also examined both clinical variables such as age, sex or comorbidities, as well as habits such as tobacco or alcohol consumption. Results: We found that sex (male) and keratinization degree (high or moderate) are directly related with OSCC recurrence. In fact, free illness time is lower in men and higher in those cases with minimal or no keratinization. Conclusions: Based on the variables analyzed, it has not been possible to establish a histological risk pattern that, complementary to the TNM classification, could have a predictive role in these early-stage tongue carcinomas.},

abstract = {Background and Objective: Growing evidence of transcriptional and metabolomic differentiation induced many studies which analyze such differentiation in context of outcome of disease progression, treatment or influence of many different factors affecting cellular and tissue metabolism. Particularly, cancer researchers are looking for new biomarkers that can serve as a diagnostic/prognostic factor and its further corresponding relationship regarding clinical effects. As a result of the increasing interest in use of dichotomization of continuous variables involving clinical or epidemiological data (gene expression, biomarkers, biochemical parameters, etc.) there is a large demand for cutoff point determination tools with simultaneous lack of software offering stratification of patients based on continuous and binary variables. Therefore, we developed “Evaluate Cutpoints” application offering wide set of statistical and graphical methods for cutpoint optimization enabling stratification of population into two or three groups. Methods: Application is based on R language including algorithms of packages such as survival, survMisc, OptimalCutpoints, maxstat, Rolr, ggplot2, GGally and plotly offering Kaplan-Meier plots and ROC curves with cutoff point determination. Results: All capabilities of Evaluate Cutpoints were illustrated with example analysis of estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptors in breast cancer cohort. Through ROC curve the cutoff points were established for expression of ESR1, PGR and ERBB2 in correlation with their immunohistochemical status (cutoff: 1301.253, 243.35, 11,434.438, respectively; sensitivity: 94{\%}, 85{\%}, 64{\%}, respectively; specificity: 93{\%}, 86{\%}, 91{\%}, respectively). Through disease-free survival analysis we divided patients into two and three groups regarding expression of ESR1, PGR and ERBB2. Example algorithm cutp showed that lowered expression of ESR1 and ERBB2 was more favorable (HR = 2.07, p = 0.0412; HR = 2.79, p = 0.0777, respectively), whereas heightened PGR expression was correlated with better prognosis (HR = 0.192, p = 0.0115). Conclusions: This work presents application Evaluate Cutpoints that is freely available to download at http://wnbikp.umed.lodz.pl/Evaluate-Cutpoints/. Currently, many softwares are used to split continuous variables such as Cutoff Finder and X-Tile, which offer distinct algorithms. Unlike them, Evaluate Cutpoints allows not only dichotomization of populations into groups according to continuous variables and binary variables, but also stratification into three groups as well as manual selection of cutoff point thus preventing potential loss of information.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The significance of mindfulness meditation (MM) has increased in recent years in both clinical settings and public health. However, ways to implement MM as a disease prevention or treatment method in the elderly is still a major challenge. A comprehensive analysis of previous studies on MM programs for the elderly in Korea will help build future integrated care programs that incorporate MM. METHODS: Seven international and Korean domestic electronic databases were searched to collect relevant clinical studies until May 30, 2020. RESULTS: Sixteen articles with twelve clinical studies were included in this review. The MM program was generally offered once a week over eight weeks with a duration of between 60 and 90 min per session. The main reason for participants' drop out was poor program compliance attributed to conflicting schedules, physical illness, or a change of mind. The program results were either positive or mixed, but the mindfulness level of the participants was improved. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes information obtained from previously published studies in Korea, on the design considerations, characteristics, and preliminary effectiveness of the MM program for the elderly. The findings can be used as preliminary data by future practitioners and/or researchers to design MM programs targeted toward the elderly; it could also help policymakers integrate MM-based strategies into integrated care programs to promote their mental health and well-being.},

Patients with MetS or other metabolic disorders are more susceptible to cancer development and recurrence and have a worse long-term prognosis. Moreover, the metabolic reprogramming observed in cancer cells has also been described as one of the new hallmarks of cancer. Thus, aberrant metabolism has been proposed as an important risk factor for cancer. Chronic inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and oncogenic signaling pathways are considered as main potential triggers. Considering the strong association between metabolism and cancer, metabolism-modulating drugs, including metformin and statins, as well as adopting a healthy lifestyle, have been extensively investigated as strategies to combat cancer. Furthermore, strategies that interfere with the metabolic rewiring of cells may also have potent anti-cancer effects. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of current knowledge on the relationship between aberrant metabolism and cancer and discuss the potential use of metabolism-targeting strategy for the treatment of cancer.},

abstract = {Although the Human Genome Project was completed 4 years ago, the catalog of human protein-coding genes remains a matter of controversy. Current catalogs list a total of ≈24,500 putative protein-coding genes. It is broadly suspected that a large fraction of these entries are functionally meaningless ORFs present by chance in RNA transcripts, because they show no evidence of evolutionary conservation with mouse or dog. However, there is currently no scientific justification for excluding ORFs simply because they fail to show evolutionary conservation: the alternative hypothesis is that most of these ORFs are actually valid human genes that reflect gene innovation in the primate lineage or gene loss in the other lineages. Here, we reject this hypothesis by carefully analyzing the nonconserved ORFs - specifically, their properties in other primates. We show that the vast majority of these ORFs are random occurrences. The analysis yields, as a by-product, a major revision of the current human catalogs, cutting the number of protein-coding genes to ≈20,500. Specifically, it suggests that nonconserved ORFs should be added to the human gene catalog only if there is clear evidence of an encoded protein. It also provides a principled methodology for evaluating future proposed additions to the human gene catalog. Finally, the results indicate that there has been relatively little true innovation in mammalian protein-coding genes. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a poor prognostic factor. The histopathologic stage (e.g., pN) is used to evaluate the severity of lymph node metastasis; however, the current staging system insufficiently predicts survival and recurrence. We investigated clinical outcomes and lymph node density (LND) in betel nut-chewing individuals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 389 betel nut-exposed patients with primary OSCC who underwent surgical resection in 2002-2015. The prognostic significance of LND was evaluated by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that the 5-year OS and DFS rates in all patients were 60.9 and 48.9{\%}, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that variables independently prognostic for OS were aged population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6, 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] = 1.1-2.5; P = .025), and cell differentiation classification (HR = 2.4, 95{\%} CI = 1.4-4.2; P = .002). In pathologic N-positive patients, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for OS was used and indicated the best cutoff of 0.05, and the multivariate analysis showed that LND was an independent predictor of OS (HR = 2.2, 95{\%} CI = 1.3-3.7; P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node density, at a cutoff of 0.05, was an independent predictor of OS and DFS. OS and DFS underwent multiple analyses, and LND remained significant. The pathologic N stage had no influence in the OS analysis. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LND is a more reliable predictor of survival in betel nut-chewing patients for further post operation adjuvant treatment, such as reoperation or adjuvant radiotherapy.},

abstract = {RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and microarray are two of the most commonly used high-throughput technologies for transcriptome profiling; however, they both have their own inherent strengths and limitations. This research aims to analyze the correlation between microarrays and RNA-Seq detection of transcripts in the same tissue sample to explore the reproducibility between the techniques. Using data of RNA-Seq v2 and three different microarrays provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas, 11,120 genes of 111 lung squamous cell carcinoma samples were simultaneously detected by the four methods. Then we analyzed the Pearson correlation between microarrays and RNA-Seq. Finally, in the six comparison results, 9984 (89.8{\%}) genes, irrespective of which two methods were used, simultaneously showed the existence of correlation, whereas only 83 (0.1{\%}) genes proved to have no significant correlation in either comparison. In addition, the comparisons between 3266 (29.3{\%}) genes showed high correlation (R ≥ 0.8) in all six comparisons, only for 1643 (14.8{\%}) genes correlation were not as high in either comparison. Meanwhile, transcripts with extreme high or low expression levels were more highly discrepant across the methods. In conclusion, we found that, for most transcripts, the results obtained by RNA-Seq and microarrays were highly reproducible.},

SUMMARYThe ability to correlate study results and surgicalmargins within a disease type is impeded by vari-ability in operational definitions, and the inclusionof patients with a spectrum of disease sites,stages, and putative histopathologic prognosticvariables, among others. Margin tissue may becomposed of multiple different tissue types, andthe microscopic tissue location, in addition to thegross anatomic location of a compromisedmargin, is important information to enable suc-cessful revision where revision is desirable.Reporting of surgical margin conditions in the liter-ature, although recently improved, is still lacking inoverall detail. The number of positive margins,tissue type, number of attempts at intraoperativerevision versus revision by second procedure,and resolving difficult-to-define concepts (‘focal'positive margin) await future study.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is the first-line chemotherapy used against most upper aerodigestive tract carcinomas. In head and neck cancer, sensitivity to cisplatin remains the key issue in treatment response and outcome. Genetic heterogeneity and aberrant gene expression may be the intrinsic factors that cause primary cisplatin-resistance. METHODS: Combination of the HNSCC gene expression data and the cisplatin sensitivity results from public database. We found that aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C1 (AKR1C1) may be associated with cisplatin sensitivity in HNSCC treatment of na{\"{i}}ve cells. We examined the AKR1C1 expression and its correlation with cisplatin IC(50) and prognosis in patients. The in vitro and in vivo AKR1C1 functions in cisplatin-resistance through overexpression or knockdown assays, respectively. cDNA microarrays were used to identify the upstream regulators that modulate AKR1C1-induced signaling in HNSCC. Finally, we used the cigarette metabolites to promote AKR1C1 expression and ruxolitinib to overcome AKR1C1-induced cisplatin-resistance. RESULTS: AKR1C1 positively correlates to cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC cells. AKR1C1 is a poor prognostic factor for recurrence and death of HNSCC patients. Silencing of AKR1C1 not only reduced in vitro IC(50) but also increased in vivo cisplatin responses and vise versa in overexpression cells. Cigarette metabolites also promote AKR1C1 expression. Transcriptome analyses revealed that STAT1 and STAT3 activation enable AKR1C1-induced cisplatin-resistance and can be overcome by ruxolitinib treatment. CONCLUSIONS: AKR1C1 is a crucial regulator for cisplatin-resistance in HNSCC and also poor prognostic marker for patients. Targeting the AKR1C1-STAT axis may provide a new therapeutic strategy to treat patients who are refractory to cisplatin treatment.},

abstract = {Objective: To analyse the incidence of appearance of second and successive neoplasms in a cohort of head and neck squamous carcinoma patients. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study with 4,458 patients with an index tumour located in the head and neck diagnosed during the 1985-2016 period. We evaluated the incidence of appearance of second neoplasms and successive neoplasms over a period of 30 years. Results: During the follow-up, 1,203 patients (27.0{\%}) had a second neoplasm, 242 patients (5.4{\%}) a third neoplasm, 58 patients (1.3{\%}) a fourth neoplasm, and 8 patients (0.2{\%}) 5 or more successive neoplasms. The incidence of appearance of second neoplasms was 3.5{\%} per year, remaining relatively constant throughout the follow-up period. The patients with a second neoplasm had a higher risk of appearance of a third neoplasm, and those with a third neoplasm had a higher risk of a fourth. Seventy-eight percent of the second neoplasms, 88{\%} of the third neoplasms, and 89.6{\%} of the fourth neoplasms appeared in locations epidemiologically related to tobacco and alcohol use. Conclusions: Second neoplasms after a head and neck index tumour appeared at a constant rate of 3.5{\%} per year throughout the entire follow-up period.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Analyzing high throughput genomics data is a complex and compute intensive task, generally requiring numerous software tools and large reference data sets, tied together in successive stages of data transformation and visualisation. A computational platform enabling best practice genomics analysis ideally meets a number of requirements, including: a wide range of analysis and visualisation tools, closely linked to large user and reference data sets; workflow platform(s) enabling accessible, reproducible, portable analyses, through a flexible set of interfaces; highly available, scalable computational resources; and flexibility and versatility in the use of these resources to meet demands and expertise of a variety of users. Access to an appropriate computational platform can be a significant barrier to researchers, as establishing such a platform requires a large upfront investment in hardware, experience, and expertise. RESULTS: We designed and implemented the Genomics Virtual Laboratory (GVL) as a middleware layer of machine images, cloud management tools, and online services that enable researchers to build arbitrarily sized compute clusters on demand, pre-populated with fully configured bioinformatics tools, reference datasets and workflow and visualisation options. The platform is flexible in that users can conduct analyses through web-based (Galaxy, RStudio, IPython Notebook) or command-line interfaces, and add/remove compute nodes and data resources as required. Best-practice tutorials and protocols provide a path from introductory training to practice. The GVL is available on the OpenStack-based Australian Research Cloud (http://nectar.org.au) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. The principles, implementation and build process are designed to be cloud-agnostic. CONCLUSIONS: This paper provides a blueprint for the design and implementation of a cloud-based Genomics Virtual Laboratory. We discuss scope, design considerations and technical and logistical constraints, and explore the value added to the research community through the suite of services and resources provided by our implementation.},

abstract = {Background: Pembrolizumab is active in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression associated with improved response. Methods: KEYNOTE-048 was a randomised, phase 3 study of participants with untreated locally incurable recurrent or metastatic HNSCC done at 200 sites in 37 countries. Participants were stratified by PD-L1 expression, p16 status, and performance status and randomly allocated (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab alone, pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy), or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (cetuximab with chemotherapy). Investigators and participants were aware of treatment assignment. Investigators, participants, and representatives of the sponsor were masked to the PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study entry. The primary endpoints were overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause) and progression-free survival (time from randomisation to radiographically confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first) in the intention-to-treat population (all participants randomly allocated to a treatment group). There were 14 primary hypotheses: superiority of pembrolizumab alone and of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with chemotherapy for overall survival and progression-free survival in the PD-L1 CPS of 20 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and total populations and non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin: 1{\textperiodcentered}2) of pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with chemotherapy for overall survival in the total population. The definitive findings for each hypothesis were obtained when statistical testing was completed for that hypothesis; this occurred at the second interim analysis for 11 hypotheses and at final analysis for three hypotheses. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population (all participants who received at least one dose of allocated treatment). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02358031. Findings: Between April 20, 2015, and Jan 17, 2017, 882 participants were allocated to receive pembrolizumab alone (n=301), pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (n=281), or cetuximab with chemotherapy (n=300); of these, 754 (85{\%}) had CPS of 1 or more and 381 (43{\%}) had CPS of 20 or more. At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone improved overall survival versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the CPS of 20 or more population (median 14{\textperiodcentered}9 months vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}61 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}83], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0007) and CPS of 1 or more population (12{\textperiodcentered}3 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}3, 0{\textperiodcentered}78 [0{\textperiodcentered}64–0{\textperiodcentered}96], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0086) and was non-inferior in the total population (11{\textperiodcentered}6 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7, 0{\textperiodcentered}85 [0{\textperiodcentered}71–1{\textperiodcentered}03]). Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved overall survival versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the total population (13{\textperiodcentered}0 months vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, HR 0{\textperiodcentered}77 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}63–0{\textperiodcentered}93], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0034) at the second interim analysis and in the CPS of 20 or more population (14{\textperiodcentered}7 vs 11{\textperiodcentered}0, 0{\textperiodcentered}60 [0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}82], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0004) and CPS of 1 or more population (13{\textperiodcentered}6 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}4, 0{\textperiodcentered}65 [0{\textperiodcentered}53–0{\textperiodcentered}80], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) at final analysis. Neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved progression-free survival at the second interim analysis. At final analysis, grade 3 or worse all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 (55{\%}) of 300 treated participants in the pembrolizumab alone group, 235 (85{\%}) of 276 in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and 239 (83{\%}) of 287 in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group. Adverse events led to death in 25 (8{\%}) participants in the pembrolizumab alone group, 32 (12{\%}) in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and 28 (10{\%}) in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group. Interpretation: Based on the observed efficacy and safety, pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil is an appropriate first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The MapReduce framework enables a scalable processing and analyzing of large datasets by distributing the computational load on connected computer nodes, referred to as a cluster. In Bioinformatics, MapReduce has already been adopted to various case scenarios such as mapping next generation sequencing data to a reference genome, finding SNPs from short read data or matching strings in genotype files. Nevertheless, tasks like installing and maintaining MapReduce on a cluster system, importing data into its distributed file system or executing MapReduce programs require advanced knowledge in computer science and could thus prevent scientists from usage of currently available and useful software solutions. RESULTS: Here we present Cloudgene, a freely available platform to improve the usability of MapReduce programs in Bioinformatics by providing a graphical user interface for the execution, the import and export of data and the reproducibility of workflows on in-house (private clouds) and rented clusters (public clouds). The aim of Cloudgene is to build a standardized graphical execution environment for currently available and future MapReduce programs, which can all be integrated by using its plug-in interface. Since Cloudgene can be executed on private clusters, sensitive datasets can be kept in house at all time and data transfer times are therefore minimized. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that MapReduce programs can be integrated into Cloudgene with little effort and without adding any computational overhead to existing programs. This platform gives developers the opportunity to focus on the actual implementation task and provides scientists a platform with the aim to hide the complexity of MapReduce. In addition to MapReduce programs, Cloudgene can also be used to launch predefined systems (e.g. Cloud BioLinux, RStudio) in public clouds. Currently, five different bioinformatic programs using MapReduce and two systems are integrated and have been successfully deployed. Cloudgene is freely available at http://cloudgene.uibk.ac.at.},

Materials and Methods This was a cross-sectional study. The study sample consisted of OSCC specimens of the GBS after composite resection. The primary predictor variable was the length of the linear margin at various locations (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral). The primary outcome variable was the percentage of change in each respective margin (anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral) after fixation in 10{\%} formalin for 24 hours. Other variables were age, gender, use of smokeless tobacco, smoking status, and tumor staging. The difference between pre-fixation and post-fixation data was calculated using paired t test. Results The sample consisted of 15 patients (7 men and 8 women; age range, 55 to 65 yr) diagnosed with OSCC of the GBS. Shrinkage of surgical margins (decrease) occurred after fixation compared with margins before fixation. The average surgical margin shrinkages were 18.7{\%} anteriorly, 14.9{\%} posteriorly, 23.6{\%} medially, and 23.9{\%} laterally. This shrinkage was statistically significant (P {\textless}.001). Conclusion Formalin fixation causes considerable shrinkage of surgical margins. This phenomenon should be considered by the pathologist before providing the final histopathology report.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all of which are supported by the experimental literature. CONCLUSION: GAGE is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways. The GAGE method is implemented in R in the "gage" package, available under the GNU GPL from http://sysbio.engin.umich.edu/{\~{}}luow/downloads.php.},

abstract = {Objectives: To compare local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) in early oral cavity cancer (OCC) patients with positive/close frozen section (FS) cleared with further resection (R1 to R0) or positive FS not cleared (R1) to those with negative margins on initial FS analysis (R0). Data Sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane. Review Methods: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) for reporting in our study. Only English-language articles that included patients with OCC and local recurrence (LR) comparisons between R0 and initially R1 to final R0 or final R1 groups were included. We requested the raw data from the corresponding authors of eligible studies and performed an individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of LRFS outcomes across groups. Results: Pooled LRFS data from 8 studies showed that patients in the R1 to R0 group had worse LRFS compared to the R0 group (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.897, P {\textless}.001). Patients in the R1 group were also found to have worse LRFS compared to the R0 group (HR = 3.795, P {\textless}.001). When compared to final R1 group, the initially R1 to final R0 only showed a trend toward better LRFS. Conclusion: Margin revision of initially positive margins to “clear” based on FS guidance does not equate to an initially negative margin and does not significantly improve local control. These findings call into question the effectiveness of the current methodology of intraoperative FS in OCC resections and call for a prospective study to determine what system of resected specimen analysis best predicts completeness of resection.},

abstract = {6011 Background: The PD-1 receptor-ligand pathway can be used by tumors to evade immune surveillance, thereby allowing neoplastic growth. MK-3475 is a highly selective, humanized IgG4/kappa isotype mAb designed to block PD-1 interaction with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, to reactivate the immune system to eradicate the host tumor. Methods: Pts with recurrent/metastatic H/N cancer were enrolled in this multi-center, non-randomized trial in two cohorts (HPV and non-HPV associated). Pts were prescreened for PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (22C3), and if positive allowed to proceed with treatment of single agent MK-3475 given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 2 wks. Primary objectives are to determine (1) safety and tolerability and (2) anti-tumor activity of MK-3475 assessed by RECIST 1.1. Secondary objectives include progression-free survival, overall survival and response duration. Results: All results are based on preliminary, unaudited data as of Jan. 27, 2014. 77.9{\%} of patients expressed PD-L1, defined as ≥1{\%} of stained cells in the tumor microenvironment (Table). Of 60 patients (11 female, 49 male) enrolled in the study, 19 had an ECOG status of 0, and 40 had an ECOG status of 1 (1 unknown); 23 were HPV+ and 37 were HPV-; 9 had no prior systemic treatment, 10 had 1, 16 had 2, 13 had 3, and 7 had ≥4 prior regimens of treatment (5 unknown). Of the patients treated with MK-3475, 78.3{\%} experienced ≥1 AE, and 46.7{\%} reported a drug-related (DR) AE. The most common DR AEs reported were pruritis (6, 10{\%}), fatigue (4, 7{\%}), rash (4, 7{\%}), and diarrhea (3, 5{\%}). At least one Grade 3-5 AE was reported in 55.0{\%} of patients, with 13.3{\%} reporting a DR Gr 3-5 AE. Grade 3-5 AEs considered DR were hyponatremia, lymphopenia, rash, diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, abscess (neck), and atrial fibrillation. Tumor shrinkage was observed in several patients, but protocol-specified efficacy analyses are not yet available. Conclusions: To date, treatment with MK-3475 has been well tolerated overall, with few serious DR AEs. Protocol-specified efficacy analyses are not yet available.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic markers for distant metastatic disease in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) are not well defined. Identification of genetic alterations associated with metastatic CRC could help to guide systemic and local treatment strategies. We evaluated the association of tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 10C (TNFRSF10C) copy number variation (CNV) with distant metastatic disease in patients with CRC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). METHODS: Genetic sequencing data and clinical characteristics were obtained from TCGA for all available patients with CRC. There were 515 CRC patient samples with CNV and clinical outcome data, including a subset of 144 rectal adenocarcinoma patient samples. Using the TCGA CRC dataset, CNV of TNFRSF10C was evaluated for association with distant metastatic disease (M1 vs. M0). Multivariate logistic regression analysis with odds ratio (OR) using a 95{\%} confidence interval (CI) was performed adjusting for age, T stage, N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, gender, microsatellite instability (MSI), location, and surgical margin status. RESULTS: TNFRSF10C CNV in patients with CRC was associated with distant metastatic disease [OR 4.81 (95{\%} CI, 2.13-10.85) P{\textless}0.001] and positive lymph nodes [OR 18.83 (95{\%} CI, 8.42-42.09)]; P{\textless}0.001) but not MSI (OR P=0.799). On multivariate analysis, after adjusting for pathologic T stage, N stage, adjuvant chemotherapy, gender, and MSI, TNFRSF10C CNV remained significantly associated with distant metastatic disease (OR P=0.018). Subset analysis revealed that TNFRSF10C CNV was also significantly associated with distant metastatic disease in patients with rectal adenocarcinoma (OR P=0.016). CONCLUSIONS: TNFRSF10C CNV in patients with CRC is associated with distant metastatic disease. With further validation, such genetic profiles could be used clinically to support optimal systemic treatment strategies versus more aggressive local therapies in patients with CRC, including radiation therapy for rectal adenocarcinoma.},

abstract = {Most head and neck cancers are derived from the mucosal epithelium in the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx and are known collectively as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Oral cavity and larynx cancers are generally associated with tobacco consumption, alcohol abuse or both, whereas pharynx cancers are increasingly attributed to infection with human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily HPV-16. Thus, HNSCC can be separated into HPV-negative and HPV-positive HNSCC. Despite evidence of histological progression from cellular atypia through various degrees of dysplasia, ultimately leading to invasive HNSCC, most patients are diagnosed with late-stage HNSCC without a clinically evident antecedent pre-malignant lesion. Traditional staging of HNSCC using the tumour–node–metastasis system has been supplemented by the 2017 AJCC/UICC staging system, which incorporates additional information relevant to HPV-positive disease. Treatment is generally multimodal, consisting of surgery followed by chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral cavity cancers and primary CRT for pharynx and larynx cancers. The EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab is generally used in combination with radiation in HPV-negative HNSCC where comorbidities prevent the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The FDA approved the immune checkpoint inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab as primary treatment for unresectable disease. Elucidation of the molecular genetic landscape of HNSCC over the past decade has revealed new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. Ongoing efforts aim to integrate our understanding of HNSCC biology and immunobiology to identify predictive biomarkers that will enable delivery of the most effective, least-toxic therapies.},

abstract = {Prognostic biomarkers are of great significance to predict the outcome of patients with cancer, to guide the clinical treatments, to elucidate tumorigenesis mechanisms, and offer the opportunity of identifying therapeutic targets. To screen and develop prognostic biomarkers, high throughput profiling methods including gene microarray and next-generation sequencing have been widely applied and shown great success. However, due to the lack of independent validation, only very few prognostic biomarkers have been applied for clinical practice. In order to cross-validate the reliability of potential prognostic biomarkers, some groups have collected the omics datasets (i.e., epigenetics/transcriptome/proteome) with relative follow-up data (such as OS/DSS/PFS) of clinical samples from different cohorts, and developed the easy-to-use online bioinformatics tools and web servers to assist the biomarker screening and validation. These tools and web servers provide great convenience for the development of prognostic biomarkers, for the study of molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and progression, and even for the discovery of important therapeutic targets. Aim to help researchers to get a quick learning and understand the function of these tools, the current review delves into the introduction of the usage, characteristics and algorithms of tools, and web servers, such as LOGpc, KM plotter, GEPIA, TCPA, OncoLnc, PrognoScan, MethSurv, SurvExpress, UALCAN, etc., and further help researchers to select more suitable tools for their own research.

Although significant improvements have been made in the treatment for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, physicians face yet another challenge—that of preserving oral functions, which involves the use of multidisciplinary therapies, such as multiple chemotherapies (CT) and radiotherapy (RT). Designing personalized therapeutic options requires the study of genes involved in drug resistance. This review provides an overview of the molecules that have been linked to resistance to chemotherapy in HNSCC, including the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCs), nucleotide excision repair/base excision repair (NER/BER) enzymatic complexes (which act on nonspecific DNA lesions generated by gamma and ultraviolet radiation by cross-linking and forming intra/interchain chemical adducts), cisplatin (a chemotherapeutic agent that causes DNA damage and induces apoptosis, which is a paradox because its effectiveness is based on the integrity of the genes involved in apoptotic signaling pathways), and cetuximab, including a discussion of the genes involved in the cell cycle and the proliferation of possible markers that confer resistance to cetuximab.},

This 3-year observational cohort followed 126 SCCHN patients treated with anti-PD-1/L1 therapy. Prior to treatment, 81 (64{\%}) had targeted massively parallel tumor sequencing. Of these, 42 (52{\%}) underwent fluorescence-activated cell sorting and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry for tumor immunoprofiling.

Fundamentally, even the definition what constitutes a “clear” (or negative) margin may vary between institutions, surgeons, and pathologists. Methods: The PubMed database was queried for articles relevant to the topic, and experts in the field were consulted regarding key articles for inclusion. Abstracts were reviewed and the full text was accessed for articles of particular interest. Results: Data regarding various approaches to traditional margin analysis have been published without consensus. Several next-generation technologies have emerged in recent years that hold promise. Conclusion: An overview and appraisal of traditional margin analysis techniques are provided. Additionally, we explore novel technologies that may assist in more accurate margin assessment, guide the extent of surgical resections intraoperatively, and inform decisions regarding adjuvant treatment postoperatively.},

abstract = {Characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment enables the identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers, the development of novel therapeutic targets and strategies, and the possibility to guide first-line treatment algorithms. Although the driving elements within the tumor microenvironment of individual primary organ sites differ, many of the salient features remain the same. The presence of a robust antitumor milieu characterized by an abundance of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, Th1 helper cells, and associated cytokines often indicates a degree of tumor containment by the immune system and can even lead to tumor elimination. Some of these features have been combined into an 'Immunoscore', which has been shown to complement the prognostic ability of the current TNM staging for early stage colorectal carcinomas. Features of the immune microenvironment are also potential therapeutic targets, and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/ PD-L1 axis are especially promising. FDA-approved indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 are rapidly expanding across numerous tumor types and, in certain cases, are accompanied by companion or complimentary PD-L1 immunohistochemical diagnostics. Pathologists have direct visual access to tumor tissue and in-depth knowledge of the histological variations between and within tumor types and thus are poised to drive forward our understanding of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the key components of the tumor microenvironment, presents an overview of and the challenges with PD-L1 antibodies and assays, and addresses newer candidate biomarkers, such as CD8+ cell density and mutational load. Characteristics of the local immune contexture and current pathology-related practices for specific tumor types are also addressed. In the future, characterization of the host antitumor immune response using multiplexed and multimodality biomarkers may help predict which patients will respond to immune-based therapies.},

The number of patients with cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 who were still alive at the end of 2008 in the adult population is described by world region, country and the human development index. The 5-year global cancer prevalence is estimated to be 28.8 million in 2008. Close to half of the prevalence burden is in areas of very high human development that comprise only one-sixth of the world's population. Breast cancer continues to be the most prevalent cancer in the vast majority of countries globally; cervix cancer is the most prevalent cancer in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia and prostate cancer dominates in North America, Oceania and Northern and Western Europe. Stomach cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Eastern Asia (including China); oral cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer in Indian men and Kaposi sarcoma has the highest 5-year prevalence among men in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The methods used to estimate point prevalence appears to give reasonable results at the global level. The figures highlight the need for long-term care targeted at managing patients with certain very frequently diagnosed cancer forms. To be of greater relevance to cancer planning, the estimation of other time-based measures of global prevalence is warranted. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2012 UICC.},

In particular, we compare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable "real-time" performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results on our predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines in intervention prediction, and provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for the adoption of such models in practice.},

abstract = {Lactic acidosis (3 to 40 mM, pH {\textless} 6.9) is a condition found in solid tumors because tumor cells have a high rate of glucose consumption and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen; nevertheless, the microenvironment might still provide a sufficient glucose supply. Lactic acidosis has been proposed to shift metabolism from aerobic glycolysis toward oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). We tested if lung tumor cells cultured under lactic acidosis shift their metabolism from glycolysis to OXPHOS by consuming extracellular lactate, increasing growth rate. We analyzed lung adenocarcinoma (A-549, A-427) cell lines and non-transformed fibroblast cells (MRC-5), which were cultured using RPMI-1640 medium initially containing lactate (2 mM) and glucose (10 mM), at pH 7.2 or 6.2 and oxygen tension 21{\%} O2 (normoxia) or 2{\%} O2 (hypoxia). We obtained growth curves, as well as glucose consumption and lactate production rates (measured during exponential growth) for each cell line. HIF-1$\alpha$ (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 $\alpha$), CS (citrate synthase) and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) transcript levels were analyzed using RT-qPCR. By flow cytometry, we determined: (a) expression of glucose transporters (GLUT)1 and 4; (b) lactate transporters (MCT)1 and 4; (c) cell cycle profile, and (d) protein levels of HIF-1$\alpha$, total and phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK). Mitochondrial functionality was evaluated by measuring O2 consumption in tumor cells using polarography and a Clark-type electrode. Tumor and non-transformed cells used both aerobic glycolysis and OXPHOS for obtaining energy. As of 48 h of culture, lactate levels ranged from (4.5–14 mM), thus forming a lactic environment. Lactic acidosis diminished GLUT1/GLUT4 expression and glucose consumption in A-549, but not in A-427 cells, and induced differential expression of HIF-1$\alpha$, AMPK, and CS transcripts. A-427 cells increased pAMPK and HIF-1$\alpha$ levels and shifted their metabolism increasing OXPHOS; thus supporting cell growth. Conversely, A-549 cells increased HIF-1$\alpha$ protein levels, but did not activate AMPK and diminished OXPHOS. A-549 cells survived by arresting cells in G1-phase. Our findings show that lactic acidosis diminishes Warburg effect in tumor cells, but this change does not necessarily promote a shift to OXPHOS. Hence, lung adenocarcinomas show a differential metabolic response even when they are under the same microenvironmental conditions.},

To gain insight into the role of NPB and NPW in human adrenal functional regulation, we have investigated their effects on the secretion and growth of the human adrenocortical carcinoma-derived NCI-H295 cell line. NCI-H295 cells were found to express both GPR7 and GPR8 mRNAs, but neither NPB nor NPW (up to 10(-6) M) affected their secretory activity. In contrast, both peptides (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) M) enhanced the growth of NCI-H295 cells, by raising their proliferative activity and lowering their apoptotic deletion rate. NPB and NPW (10(-6) M) stimulated tyrosine kinase (TK) and mitogen-activated PK (MAPK) p42/p44 activities in NCI-H295 cells. Both these effects were blocked by the TK inhibitor tyrphostin-23, while the MAPK p42/p44 inhibitor PD-98059 annulled only MAPK p42/p44 activation. The growth-stimulating effect of 10(-6) M NPB and NPW were not affected by either the PKA and PKC inhibitors H-89 and calphostin-C or the MAPK p38 antagonist SB-293580, but were abolished by both tyrphostin-23 and PD-98059. Taken together, our findings allow us to conclude that GPR7 and GPR8 expressed in NCI-H295 cells: i) are, at variance with those present in normal human adrenocortical cells, uncoupled to PKA- and PKC-dependent cascades, thereby explaining the absence of any secretory response to NPB and NPW; and ii) are coupled to the TK-dependent MAPK p42/p44 signaling, whose activation mediates the proliferogenic and antiapoptotic effect of NPB and NPW.},

abstract = {Co-expression modules are groups of genes with highly correlated expression patterns. In cancer, differences in module activity potentially represent the heterogeneity of phenotypes important in carcinogenesis, progression, or treatment response. To find gene expression modules active in breast cancer subpopulations, we assembled 72 breast cancer-related gene expression datasets containing ∼5,700 samples altogether. Per dataset, we identified genes with bimodal expression and used mixture model clustering to ultimately define 11 modules of genes that are consistently co-regulated across multiple datasets. Functionally, these modules reflected estrogen signaling, development/ differentiation, immune signaling, histone modification, ERBB2 signaling, the extracellular matrix (ECM) and stroma, and cell proliferation. The Tcell/Bcell immune modules appeared tumor-extrinsic, with coherent expression in tumors but not cell lines; whereas most other modules, interferon and ECM included, appeared intrinsic. Only four of the eleven modules were represented in the PAM50 intrinsic subtype classifier and other well-established prognostic signatures; although the immune modules were highly correlated to previously published immune signatures. As expected, the proliferation module was highly associated with decreased recurrence-free survival (RFS). Interestingly, the immune modules appeared associated with RFS even after adjustment for receptor subtype and proliferation; and in a multivariate analysis, the combination of Tcell/Bcell immune module down-regulation and proliferation module upregulation strongly associated with decreased RFS. Immune modules are unusual in that their upregulation is associated with a good prognosis without chemotherapy and a good response to chemotherapy, suggesting the paradox of high immune patients who respond to chemotherapy but would do well without it. Other findings concern the ECM/stromal modules, which despite common themes were associated with different sites of metastasis, possibly relating to the "seed and soil" hypothesis of cancer dissemination. Overall, co-expression modules provide a high-level functional view of breast cancer that complements the "cancer hallmarks" and may form the basis for improved predictors and treatments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wolf et al.},

abstract = {Validating prognostic or predictive candidate genes in appropriately powered breast cancer cohorts are of utmost interest. Our aim was to develop an online tool to draw survival plots, which can be used to assess the relevance of the expression levels of various genes on the clinical outcome both in untreated and treated breast cancer patients. A background database was established using gene expression data and survival information of 1,809 patients downloaded from GEO (Affymetrix HGU133A and HGU133?2 microarrays). The median relapse free survival is 6.43 years, 968/1,231 patients are estrogenreceptor (ER) positive, and 190/1,369 are lymph-node positive. After quality control and normalization only probes present on both Affymetrix platforms were retained (n = 22,277). In order to analyze the prognostic value of a particular gene, the cohorts are divided into two groups according to the median (or upper/lower quartile) expression of the gene. The two groups can be compared in terms of relapse free survival, overall survival, and distant metastasis free survival. A survival curve is displayed, and the hazard ratio with 95{\%} confidence intervals and logrank P value are calculated and displayed. Additionally, three subgroups of patients can be assessed: systematically untreated patients, endocrine-Treated ER positive patients, and patients with a distribution of clinical characteristics representative of those seen in general clinical practice in the US. Web address: www.kmplot.com. We used this integrative data analysis tool to confirm the prognostic power of the proliferation-related genes TOP2A and TOP2B, MKI67, CCND2, CCND3, CCNDE2, as well as CDKN1A, and TK2. We also validated the capability of microarrays to determine estrogen receptor status in 1,231 patients. The tool is highly valuable for the preliminary assessment of biomarkers, especially for research groups with limited bioinformatic resources. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2009.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE There is controversy surrounding surgical margins in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC), with debate regarding the assessment and prognostic value of margins. OBJECTIVE To analyze a large cohort of OCSCC cases for correlation between tumor specimen margins and intraoperative tumor bed frozen margins and evaluate how margin status associates with local recurrence and survival. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 406 patients treated with OCSCC resection between 2005 and 2014 at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Included cases underwent margin evaluation on the tumor specimen and intraoperative frozen margin assessment from the tumor bed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Findings of intraoperative frozen margin analysis as a test of tumor specimen margins; local recurrence and survival based on margin findings; prognosis based on clearance of positive frozen margins. To evaluate whether additional resection to "clear" positive frozen margins affected prognosis, we compared local recurrence rates for patients in 3 groups: group A included those patients with negative margins on both intraoperative and permanent specimens; group B included those with positive intraoperative margins subsequently cleared by additional resection to negative margins; and group C included those with negative intraoperative but positive permanent specimen margins. RESULTS The median age of the 406 patients (234 men and 172 women) was 61 years (interquartile range, 53-72 years). When frozen margins were correlated with tumor specimen margins, frozen margin accuracy was 65{\%}, with a 46{\%}false-negative rate.We observed a local recurrence rate of 36{\%}(95{\%}CI, 24{\%}-49{\%}) when invasive carcinoma was present at an intraoperative frozen margin and 45{\%}(95{\%}CI, 34{\%}-57{\%}) when invasive carcinoma was found on the permanent specimen margin compared with 19{\%} (95{\%}CI, 14{\%}-26{\%}) and 13{\%} (95{\%}CI, 7{\%}-22{\%}) for completely negative frozen and permanent margin findings, respectively. There was a significant difference in local recurrence between group A (13{\%}) and group B (27{\%}) (absolute difference, 14{\%}; 95{\%}CI, 3{\%}-26{\%}) and between group A and group C (34{\%}) (absolute difference, 21{\%}; 95{\%}CI, 8{\%}-34{\%}), but there was no difference between groups B and C (absolute difference, 7{\%}; 95{\%}CI, -8{\%}to 22{\%}), suggesting that additional resection to clear positive frozen margins does not improve prognosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Intraoperative frozen margins from the tumor bed are not ideal predictors of positive margins on the main specimen. Both frozen and specimen margins are associated with local recurrence, but the specimen margin has the stronger association. Importantly, we demonstrate that clearing positive frozen margins from the tumor bed is not associated with improved outcomes.},

abstract = {Purpose: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Its endogenous inhibitor (hCaKIIN$\alpha$) is expressed in some cell types. We determined the role of CaMKII in RET-stimulated proliferation and hCaMKIIN$\alpha$ in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Experimental Design: We analyzed the role of RET mutants on CaMKII activation in NIH3T3 and in MTC cell lines, and determined the effect of CaMKII inhibition on RET/ERK pathway and cell proliferation. Then the expression of hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA was determined by real-time PCR in primary MTC and it was correlated with some clinicopathologic parameters. Results: RETC634Y and RETM918T mutants expressed in NIH3T3 cells induced CaMKII activation. CaMKII was activated in unstimulated MTC cells carrying the same RET mutants and it was inhibited by RET inhibition. Inhibition of CaMKII in these cells induced a reduction of Raf-1, MEK, and ERK phosphorylation, cyclin D expression, and cell proliferation. hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA expression in primary MTC was very variable and did not correlate with gender and age at diagnosis. Serum calcitonin, (R2 = 0.032; P = 0.017), tumor volume (P = 0.0079), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.033), and staging (P = 0.0652) were negatively correlated with the hCaKIIN$\alpha$ mRNA expression. Conclusions: CaMKII is activated by RET mutants and is activated at baseline in MTC cells where it mediates the oncogenic pathway leading to cell proliferation. The mRNA expression of its endogenous inhibitor hCaKIIN$\alpha$ inversely correlates with the severity of MTC. CaMKII might represent a new target for MTC therapy and hCaKIIN$\alpha$ is a marker of disease extension. Clin Cancer Res; 20(6); 1513–20. {\textcopyright}2014 AACR.},

Methods: Retrospective data from 612 patients with oral carcinoma were analyzed for the effect of margin status on locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 90 cases (14.7{\%}) had close margins and 26 patients (4.2{\%}) had positive margins. Recurrences were documented in 173 patients (28{\%}), of which 137 (22{\%} of the study sample) were locoregional, and 164 patients (27{\%}) had died. Among patients with close or positive margins, a cutoff of 1 mm optimally separated LRFS (adjusted p = 0.0190) and OS curves (adjusted p = 0.0168) whereas a cutoff of 2 mm was sufficient to significantly separate DFS curves (adjusted p = 0.0281). Conclusions: Patients with oral carcinoma with positive margins ({\textless} 1 mm) had poorer outcomes compared to those with close margins (1–5 mm) in terms of LRFS, DFS and OS.

abstract = {Background:Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related death. In the present research, we adopted a comprehensive bioinformatics method to identify some biomarkers associated with the tumor progression and prognosis of PCa.Methods:Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were applied for exploring gene modules correlative with tumor progression and prognosis of PCa. Clinically Significant Modules were distinguished, and Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were used to Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were used in selecting potential hub genes. RNA-Seq data and clinical materials of prostate cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were used for the identification and validation of hub genes. The significance of these genes was confirmed via survival analysis and immunohistochemistry.Results:2688 DEGs were filtered. Weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and DEGs were divided into 6 modules. Two modules were selected as hub modules which were highly associated with the tumor grades. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on genes in hub modules. Thirteen hub genes in these hub modules were identified through PPT networks. Based on TCGA data, 4 of them (CCNB1, TTK, CNN1, and ACTG2) were correlated with prognosis. The protein levels of CCNB1, TTK, and ACTG2 had a degree of differences between tumor tissues and normal tissues.Conclusion:Four hub genes were identified as candidate biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for further studies of exploring molecular mechanisms and individual therapy on PCa.},

abstract = {With the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, existing antibiotics are losing their potency. Antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) represent an exciting class of drug candidates, particularly because their mechanism of action is unlikely to induce drug resistance. If resistance to AmPs were also slower to emerge in the clinic, they would have longer useful lifetimes than existing antibiotics. Nevertheless, a number of limitations exist for AmPs in the clinic. The high cost of peptide manufacture requires that highly potent sequences are created. Additionally, AmP selectivity must be improved if effective systemic doses are to be given without hemolytic activity or other toxicity. Improved high-throughput methods for AmP design or discovery could enable the achievement of both of these goals. To this end, we developed an approach based on the discovery of semi-conserved motifs across natural AmPs, which we demonstrated are associated with antimicrobial activity. Additionally, we created novel AmP formulations that may bypass some of these clinical limitations. In order to evaluate AmP design approaches, a high-throughput production and assay platform was created using in vitro translation. This technology may produce peptides that would be toxic to recombinant hosts and synthesize peptides of arbitrary length. The cost per peptide was minimized through a series of process improvements. First, we created methods to construct oligonucleotides that mimicked our motif-based design of AmPs. This approach allowed the reuse of primers for many peptides, reducing cost and enabling the study of pattern synergy. Additionally, we found peptide translation was enhanced by co-translating a fusion partner in frame with the AmP. The AmP could be freed from the fusion partner after translation using enterokinase digestion. Further, we increased yield 3-fold by optimizing the length of fusion partner. The partner was made as short as possible to limit the translational resources required to synthesize the fusion partner, while being long enough to ensure stability from proteases. The solubility of the fusion partner-AmP construct was also improved through the selection of a highly soluble partner of the optimal length. Finally, we developed a purification scheme to ensure that the in vitro translation extract would not impact measurement of antimicrobial activity. We also developed and evaluated the design of AmPs using semi-conserved motifs. We used a database of over 500 natural AmPs as a training set for pattern},

abstract = {Currently available risk prediction methods are limited in their ability to deal with complex, heterogeneous, and longitudinal data such as that available in primary care records, or in their ability to deal with multiple competing risks. This paper develops a novel deep learning approach that is able to successfully address current limitations of standard statistical approaches such as landmarking and joint modeling. Our approach, which we call Dynamic-DeepHit, flexibly incorporates the available longitudinal data comprising various repeated measurements (rather than only the last available measurements) in order to issue dynamically updated survival predictions for one or multiple competing risk(s). Dynamic-DeepHit learns the time-to-event distributions without the need to make any assumptions about the underlying stochastic models for the longitudinal and the time-to-event processes. Thus, unlike existing works in statistics, our method is able to learn data-driven associations between the longitudinal data and the various associated risks without underlying model specifications. We demonstrate the power of our approach by applying it to a real-world longitudinal dataset from the U.K. Cystic Fibrosis Registry, which includes a heterogeneous cohort of 5883 adult patients with annual follow-ups between 2009 to 2015. The results show that Dynamic-DeepHit provides a drastic improvement in discriminating individual risks of different forms of failures due to cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, our analysis utilizes post-processing statistics that provide clinical insight by measuring the influence of each covariate on risk predictions and the temporal importance of longitudinal measurements, thereby enabling us to identify covariates that are influential for different competing risks.},

Machine learning, however, can accurately model survival of patients in such a highly heterogeneous cohort, while treating CVD and cancer as competing risks. We have demonstrated this our lab's own survival models for competing risks, DeepHit and Dynamic-DeepHit, which offer personalized actionable prognoses that clinicians can use to design personalized treatment plans. Experiments on real-world data have demonstrated that our models outperform state-of-the-art survival models.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Therapies may be more efficacious when targeting a patient subpopulation with specific attributes, thereby enhancing the cost-effectiveness of treatment. In the CRYSTAL study, patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were treated with cetuximab plus FOLFIRI or FOLFIRI alone until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects or withdrawal of consent. OBJECTIVE: To determine if stratified use of cetuximab based on genetic biomarker detection improves cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We used individual patient data from CRYSTAL to compare the cost-effectiveness, cost per life-year (LY) and cost per quality-adjusted LY (QALY) gained of cetuximab plus FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI alone in three cohorts of patients with mCRC: all randomised patients (intent-to-treat; ITT), tumours with no detectable mutations in codons 12 and 13 of exon 2 of the KRAS protein ('KRAS wt') and no detectable mutations in exons 2, 3 and 4 of KRAS and exons 2, 3 and 4 of NRAS ('RAS wt'). Survival analysis was conducted using RStudio, and a cost-utility model was modified to allow comparison of the three cohorts. RESULTS: The deterministic base-case ICER (cost per QALY gained) was pound130,929 in the ITT, pound72,053 in the KRAS wt and pound44,185 in the RAS wt cohorts for cetuximab plus FOLFIRI compared with FOLFIRI alone. At a pound50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold, cetuximab plus FOLFIRI has a 2.8, 20 and 63{\%} probability of being cost-effective for the ITT, KRAS wt and RAS wt cohorts, respectively, versus FOLFIRI alone. CONCLUSION: Screening for mutations in both KRAS and NRAS may provide the most cost-effective approach to patient selection.},

The gene-annotation enrichment analysis is a promising high-throughput strategy that increases the likelihood for investigators to identify biological processes most pertinent to their study. Approximately 68 bioinformatics enrichment tools that are currently available in the community are collected in this survey. Tools are uniquely categorized into three major classes, according to their underlying enrichment algorithms. The comprehensive collections, unique tool classifications and associated questions/issues will provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date view regarding the advantages, pitfalls and recent trends in a simpler tool-class level rather than by a tool-by-tool approach.

Under this framework, one-way stressors can be transduced into cellular changes is through central nervous system (CNS) modulation of peripheral neural, endocrine, and molecular activity. Mindfulness meditation is a consciousness discipline used to cultivate attention and self-regulation, and may thus be relevant to the signal transduction process outlined in the social genomics literature. In this opinion article, we briefly review results from existing controlled trials that test the effects of mindfulness meditation on gene expression. We then speculate on a mind-body conceptual model, grounded in existing social genomics theory. In the spirit of hypothesis generation, we argue that mindfulness meditation changes brain activity patterns related to attention, self-regulation, and threat evaluation and so may alter the signal transduction process that regulates the expression of immune response genes.},

abstract = {Purpose The primary cause of death due to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is local treatment failure. The goal of this study was to examine this phenomenon using an unbiased approach. Experimental design We utilized HPV-negative cell lines rendered radiation resistant (RR) via repeated exposure to radiation, a panel of HPV-negative HNSCC cell lines and three cohorts of HPV-negative HNSCC tumors (n=68, 97, {\&} 114) from patients treated with radiotherapy and subjected to genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Results RR cell lines exhibited up-regulation of several proteins compared to controls, including increased activation of Axl and PI3 kinase signaling as well as increased expression of PD-L1. Additionally, inhibition of either Axl or PI3 kinase led to decreased PD-L1 expression. When clinical samples were subjected to RPPA and mRNA expression analysis in separate cohorts, PD-L1 was correlated with both Axl and PI3K signaling as well as dramatically associated with local failure following radiotherapy. This finding was confirmed examining a third cohort using immunohistochemistry. Indeed, tumors with high expression of PD-L1 had failure rates following radiotherapy of 60{\%}, 70{\%} and 50{\%} compared to 20{\%}, 25{\%} and 20{\%} in the PD-L1 low expression group (p=0.01, 1.9×10−3 and 9×10−4 respectively). This finding remained significant on multivariate analysis in all groups. Additionally, those patients with PD-L1 low/CD8+TILs high had no local failure or death due to disease (p=5×10−4 and p=4×10−4 respectively). Conclusions Taken together, our data point to a targetable Axl-PI3 kinase-PD-L1 axis that is highly associated with radiation resistance.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical oncologists rely heavily on the histopathological assessment of surgical margins to ensure total excision of the tumor in patients with head and neck cancer. However, current techniques may not detect small numbers of cancer cells at the margins of resection or in cervical lymph nodes. METHODS: We used molecular techniques to determine whether clonal populations of infiltrating tumor cells harboring mutations of the p53 gene could be detected in histopathologically negative surgical margins and cervical lymph nodes of patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. RESULTS: We identified 25 patients with primary squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck containing a p53 mutation who appeared to have had complete tumor resection on the basis of a negative histopathological assessment. In 13 of these 25 patients, molecular analysis was positive for a p53 mutation in at least one tumor margin. In 5 of 13 patients with positive margins by this method (38 percent), the carcinoma has recurred locally, as compared with none of 12 patients with negative margins (P = 0.02 by the log-rank test). Furthermore, molecular analysis identified neoplastic cells in 6 of 28 lymph nodes (21 percent) that were initially negative by histopathological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Among specimens initially believed to be negative by light microscopy, a substantial percentage of the surgical margins and lymph nodes from patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck contained p53 mutations specific for the primary tumor. Patients with these positive margins appear to have a substantially increased risk of local recurrence. Molecular analysis of surgical margins and lymph nodes can augment standard histopathological assessment and may improve the prediction of local tumor recurrence.},

abstract = {Background and Aims One of the significant proportions in delivering holistic healthcare in dental practice is spiritual care. World Health Organisation has called worldwide for delivering person-centred care from the physical, emotional, socio-economic and spiritual perspectives. However, there were limited literature and strategies for spiritual care delivery in dental practice. We aim to provide 12 tips to integrate spiritual care delivery strategies and techniques for dental educators according to the spiritual care theory developed by Schweitzer Christian and Missionary Alliance (SCMA). Methods The tips, using the grounded theory technique, were constructed with the reflective observations of the experienced clinician- educators and the literature review of applying the framework of spiritual care theory and person-centred learning in dental education and practice. Results The 12 tips for the dental educators training learners about performing spiritual care in dentistry are respectively addressed: 1) Delivering prior knowledge of the spiritual care theory before/during the early clinical exposure. 2) Systematically integrating the spiritual care assessment and pathological examination when delivering the training of pathological assessments. 3) Being mindful to patient's mental health and emotional changes during the dental care. 4) Taking patient's socioeconomic statement thoroughly for building a holistic consideration. 5) Patent's supporting system is essential for the spiritual care. 6) Being aware of dental interventions could affect patient's self-image and values. 7) Patient's history of illness could affect the approaches of spiritual care in dentistry. 8) Learning to listen proactively 9) Therapeutic relationship is an essential key towards spiritual care. 10) Instructing passive aggressively. 11) Being aware of patient's spiritual needs during/after treatment. 12) Applying the holistic healthcare strategies, such as the Shared Decision Marking, to collect more spiritual-related information of patients in the treating process and adjusting the approaches dynamically. Conclusion The 12 tips presented effectively offer specific coaching strategies to engage trainers, enlarge their clinical perspectives and enhance the effectiveness of the trainers' coaching efficacy when delivering spiritual care training in dental practice. This paper contributes to regulate and establish the particular inter-disciplinary training strategies for providing spiritual care during the dental care in practice.},

We illustrated workflow of this package with data from 797 patients with cervical cancer. By analyzing several risk factors of cervical cancer such as tumor size, body mass index (BMI), number of lymph nodes involved and depth of stromal invasion, in relation to survival and clinical outcome such as lymph nodal metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, we demonstrated that the best choice for BMI and stromal invasion was two cutoff points and one for the others.

abstract = {Background: The most accurate predictor of disease recurrence in patients treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is, at present, the extent of regional lymph node metastasis. Since elevated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of its ligand, transforming growth factor-$\alpha$ (TGF-$\alpha$), have been detected in primary tumors of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we determined whether tumor levels of these proteins were of prognostic importance. Methods: Monoclonal antibodies specific for EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ were used for immunohistochemical detection of each protein in tissue sections of primary tumors from 91 patients who were treated by surgical resection. Levels of immunoreactive EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ were quantified by use of a computerized image analysis system and were normalized to appropriate standards. The logrank test and proportional hazards regression analysis were used to calculate the probability that EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ levels were associated with disease-free survival (i.e., no recurrence of cancer) and cause-specific survival (i.e., patients do not die of their disease). All P values were two-sided. Results: When tumor levels of EGFR or TGF-$\alpha$ were analyzed as continuous variables, disease-free survival and cause-specific survival were reduced among patients with higher levels of EGFR (both P = .0001) or TGF-$\alpha$ (both P = .0001). In a multivariate analysis, tumor site, tumor level of EGFR, and tumor level of TGF-$\alpha$ were statistically significant predictors of disease-free survival; in a similar analysis, regional lymph node stage and tumor levels of EGFR and of TGF-$\alpha$ were significant predictors of cause-specific survival. Conclusion: Quantitation of EGFR and TGF-$\alpha$ protein levels in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas may be useful in identifying subgroups of patients at high risk of tumor recurrence and in guiding therapy.},

The on-demand reporting tool can be accessed at: https://crsp.louisville.edu/shiny/handhygiene. CONCLUSIONS: This data collection and automated analytics engine provides an easy-to-use environment for evaluating hand hygiene data; it also provides rapid feedback to healthcare workers. By reducing some of the data management workload required of the infection preventionist, more focused interventions may be instituted to increase global hand hygiene rates and reduce infection.},

Methods The influence of resection margin size and local recurrence for 295 patients with pT1/T2 oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) treated by primary surgery, including neck dissection, between 1998 and 2010 was analyzed. Results Overall, there was a trend toward increased local recurrence with close or involved margins. When stratified according to nodal status, there was no relationship between margin size and local recurrence for the pN0 group. Conclusion The size of the resection margin does not seem to influence local control in stage I/II oral cancer. With future advances in preoperative neck staging, this data may help plan personalized therapy in head and neck cancer.},

abstract = {Survival analysis has attracted the development of new deep learning models, most notably the recent state-of-the-art model DeepHit for competing risks. However, in real-world medical settings with many features and insufficient data, deep learning models can suffer from severe performance deficits. In this dissertation, we propose robust changes to DeepHit's architecture and training procedure to counter this problem. Furthermore, we develop several methods to improve DeepHit's performance through novel approaches to automatic feature selection in deep survival analysis. We propose both filter and hybrid methods for hard feature selection, as well as neural network architecture adaptations that achieve soft feature selection. Despite only sparse literature around feature selection for deep neural networks, and little previous evidence for its benefits, our experiments on two medical datasets demonstrate that substantial performance improvements against the original DeepHit model are achievable.},

abstract = {Immunotherapy is innovating clinical cancer management. Nevertheless, only a small fraction of patients benefit from current immunotherapies. To improve clinical management of cancer immunotherapy, it is critical to develop strategies for response monitoring and prediction. In this study, we describe Inducible T cell Costimulator (ICOS) as a conserved mediator of immune response across multiple therapy strategies. ICOS expression was evaluated by flow cytometry, 89Zr-DFO-ICOS mAb PET/CT imaging was performed on Lewis lung cancer models treated with different immunotherapy strategies, and the change in tumor volume was used as a read-out for therapeutic response. ImmunoPET imaging of ICOS enabled sensitive and specific detection of activated T cells and early benchmarking of immune response. A STING agonist was identified as a promising therapeutic approach in this manner. The STING agonist generated significantly stronger immune responses as measured by ICOS ImmunoPET and delayed tumor growth compared to PD-1 checkpoint blockade. More importantly, ICOS ImmunoPET enabled early and robust prediction of therapeutic response across multiple treatment regimens. This data shows that ICOS is an indicator of T cell-mediated immune response and suggests ICOS ImmunoPET as a promising strategy for monitoring, comparing, and predicting immunotherapy success in cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aims to investigate EGFR as a prognostic biomarker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). METHODS: OPSCC patients from retrospective (1998-2009) and prospective cohorts (2014-2017) were included. Retrospectively collected tumors were used to construct tissue microarrays (TMAs), which were stained with EGFR, p16, DAPI and Pan-cytokeratin, and digitally quantified. EGFR, CDKN2A and HPV E6/7 levels from prospectively collected OPSCC was measured by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Biomarkers were compared to patient covariates, factors and survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 249 patients were included retrospectively and 64 patients were enrolled prospectively. p16 status (p {\textless} 0.001), smoking above 10 pack years (p = 0.04), smoking above 20 pack years (p {\textless} 0.001), total EGFR tumor levels (p = 0.016), and high EGFR within high or low Ki67 tumor nuclear staining (p = 0.03) were found to be significant predictors of 5-year disease specific survival (DSS). A Cox proportional hazard model of DSS showed smoking status and eGFR expression to be dependent of each other on predicting 5-year DSS. ddPCR analysis showed a significant association between smoking status and EGFR levels. CONCLUSIONS: Total EGFR tumor levels are predictive of 5-year DSS. EGFR levels correlate with. smoking and could be an objective marker for this disease etiology.},

The placebo effect is a core component of health care, and if one considers a contemporary view of placebo effects, this has likely been the case for as long as records exist. An exploration of placebos and placebo effects across several centuries demonstrates many interesting facts, ranging from very early writings and experiments to the modern investigation of placebo mechanisms. A longitudinal review reveals the many challenges that have been faced, whether this is understanding what a placebo is, why it may work, and the meaning of such responses for routine clinical practice. At the core of this process are the concepts surrounding placebo, as these are imperative in the application of placebo to both routine clinical care and in the context of clinical trial design. This narrative review will look at the history of placebo, particularly key aspects over time, with a view to presenting a modern re-conceptualization of this field so as to facilitate ongoing scientific inquiry and to improve health care.},

These projects have provided unprecedented opportunities to interrogate the epigenome of cultured cancer cell lines as well as normal and tumor tissues with high genomic resolution. The bioconductor project offers more than 1,000 open-source software and statistical packages to analyze high-throughput genomic data. However, most packages are designed for specific data types (e.g. expression, epigenetics, genomics) and there is no comprehensive tool that provides a complete integrative analysis harnessing the resources and data provided by all three public projects. A need to create an integration of these different analyses was recently proposed. In this workflow, we provide a series of biologically focused integrative downstream analyses of different molecular data. We describe how to download, process and prepare TCGA data and by harnessing several key bioconductor packages, we describe how to extract biologically meaningful genomic and epigenomic data and by using Roadmap and ENCODE data, we provide a workplan to identify candidate biologically relevant functional epigenomic elements associated with cancer. To illustrate our workflow, we analyzed two types of brain tumors : low-grade glioma (LGG) versus high-grade glioma (glioblastoma multiform or GBM).

Human papillomavirus has also been strongly implicated as a causative agent in a subset of these cancers. The complex anatomy and vital physiological role of the tumour-involved structures dictate that the goals of treatment are not only to improve survival outcomes but also to preserve organ function. Major improvements have been accomplished in surgical techniques and radiotherapy delivery. Moreover, systemic therapy including chemotherapy and molecularly targeted agents-namely, the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors-has been successfully integrated into potentially curative treatment of locally advanced squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In deciding which treatment strategy would be suitable for an individual patient, important considerations include expected functional outcomes, ability to tolerate treatment, and comorbid illnesses. The collaboration of many specialties is the key for optimum assessment and decision making.

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully.

Conventionally, such an analysis is based on individual genes, but the results are often noisy and difficult to interpret. Using a biological network as the searching platform, network-based biomarkers are expected to be more robust and provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease. We have developed a novel bioinformatics web server for identifying network-based biomarkers that most correlate with patient survival data, SurvNet. The web server takes three input files: one biological network file, representing a gene regulatory or protein interaction network; one molecular profiling file, containing any type of gene- or protein-centred high-throughput biological data (e.g. microarray expression data or DNA methylation data); and one patient survival data file (e.g. patients' progression-free survival data). Given user-defined parameters, SurvNet will automatically search for subnetworks that most correlate with the observed patient survival data. As the output, SurvNet will generate a list of network biomarkers and display them through a user-friendly interface. SurvNet can be accessed at http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/SurvNet.},

abstract = {Objectives To improve margin revision, this study characterizes the number, fragmentation, and orientation of tumor bed margins (TBM) in patients with pT1-2 pN0 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oral tongue. Materials and Methods Pathology reports (n = 346) were reviewed. TBM parameters were indexed. In Group 1 patients all margins were obtained from the glossectomy specimen and there were no TBM. In Revision Group/Group 2 (n = 103), tumor bed was sampled to revise suboptimal margins identified by examination of the glossectomy specimen. In Group 3 (n = 124), TBM were obtained before examination of the glossectomy specimen. Results and Conclusions Fewer TBMs were obtained per patient in Group 2 compared to Group 3 (57/103, 55{\%} of patients with {\textless}3 vs. 117/124, 94{\%}, ≥3 TBMs, respectively). The new margin surface was more frequently indicated in Group 2 compared to Group 3 (59/103, 57{\%}, vs. 19/124, 15{\%}, p {\textless}.001). If glossectomy specimen margins are accepted as the reference standard, then the TBM was 15{\%} sensitive in Group 2 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 7–29) and 32{\%} sensitive in Group 3 (95{\%} CI, 15–55). TBM fragmentation (23/103, 22{\%} vs. 42/124, 34{\%}) and frozen vs. permanent discrepancies (8/103, 3{\%} vs. 3/124, 2{\%}) were similar between Groups 2 and 3. The new margin surface was not indicated in 6 of 11 cases with discrepant frozen vs. permanent pathology findings, precluding judgment on final margin status. To facilitate the assessment of final margins, TBM should be represented by one tissue fragment with a marked new margin surface.},

As we begin to consider using the results of HPV testing for clinical purposes beyond simple prognostication, such as making decisions on treatment dose or duration or for targeted therapies that may be highly dependent on viral-mediated pathways, we need to be more rigorous in assessing and ensuring the performance of the test (or tests) used. Here we provide an overview of the platforms and technologies, including the strengths and limitations of each test, and discuss what steps are needed to generate confidence in their performance for use in clinical practice.

abstract = {Although placebos have long been considered a nuisance in clinical research, today they represent an active and productive field of research and, because of the involvement of many mechanisms, the study of the placebo effect can actually be viewed as a melting pot of concepts and ideas for neuroscience. Indeed, there exists not a single but many placebo effects, with different mechanisms and in different systems, medical conditions, and therapeutic interventions. For example, brain mechanisms of expectation, anxiety, and reward are all involved, as well as a variety of learning phenomena, such as Pavlovian conditioning, cognitive, and social learning. There is also some experimental evidence of different genetic variants in placebo responsiveness. The most productive models to better understand the neurobiology of the placebo effect are pain and Parkinson's disease. In these medical conditions, the neural networks that are involved have been identified: that is, the opioidergic-cholecystokinergic-dopaminergic modulatory network in pain and part of the basal ganglia circuitry in Parkinson's disease. Important clinical implications emerge from these recent advances in placebo research. First, as the placebo effect is basically a psychosocial context effect, these data indicate that different social stimuli, such as words and rituals of the therapeutic act, may change the chemistry and circuitry of the patient's brain. Second, the mechanisms that are activated by placebos are the same as those activated by drugs, which suggests a cognitive/affective interference with drug action. Third, if prefrontal functioning is impaired, placebo responses are reduced or totally lacking, as occurs in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Precision medicine just witnessed two breakthroughs in oncology in 2017. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda), Merck's anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), received accelerated approval in May 2017 by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have been identified as having microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR). Shortly after, nivolumab (Opdivo), Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1 mAb, gained an accelerated approval in August 2017 for adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed after standard chemotherapy. These regulatory approvals marked an important milestone that a cancer treatment may be approved based on a common biomarker rather than the anatomic location in the body where the tumor originated, and therefore established a precedent for tumor type-agnostic therapy. In the 2017 American Society for Clinical Oncology annual meeting, larotrectinib (LOXO-101), Loxooncology's oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of tropomyosin receptor kinases (TRK), demonstrated unprecedented efficacy on unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK)-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients. Both the anti-PD-1 mAbs and the TRK-targeting therapies share some basic features: (a) biomarker-based, well-defined rare patient population; (b) exceptionally high clinical efficacy, e.g., near 40{\%} overall response rate (ORR) for pembrolizumab across 15 tumor types with MSI-H/dMMR and 75{\%} ORR for larotrectinib across more than 12 tumor types with NTRK-fusion proteins; (c) durable responses lasting at least 6 months with complete responses observed; and (d) parallel development in adult and pediatric populations. With increasing accessibility to genetic analysis tools such as next-generation sequencing, tumor type-agnostic therapy has become a reality, both during clinical development and in clinical practice. Adjustments in our approaches to developing new anti-cancer drugs and to adopting these new cancer treatments in clinical practice need to occur in order to prepare ourselves for the new era of precision medicine.},

abstract = {Human cancer cells typically harbour multiple chromosomal aberrations, nucleotide substitutions and epigenetic modifications that drive malignant transformation. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pilot project aims to assess the value of large-scale multi-dimensional analysis of these molecular characteristics in human cancer and to provide the data rapidly to the research community. Here we report the interim integrative analysis of DNA copy number, gene expression and DNA methylation aberrations in 206 glioblastomas - the most common type of adult brain cancer - and nucleotide sequence aberrations in 91 of the 206 glioblastomas. This analysis provides new insights into the roles of ERBB2, NF1 and TP53, uncovers frequent mutations of the phosphatidylinositol-3- OH kinase regulatory subunit gene PIK3R1, and provides a network view of the pathways altered in the development of glioblastoma. Furthermore, integration of mutation, DNA methylation and clinical treatment data reveals a link between MGMT promoter methylation and a hypermutator phenotype consequent to mismatch repair deficiency in treated glioblastomas, an observation with potential clinical implications. Together, these findings establish the feasibility and power of TCGA, demonstrating that it can rapidly expand knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer. {\textcopyright}2008 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Almost since Wilhelm Roentgen discovered the x-ray in 1896, there has been interest in the use of radiation as treatment for malignant disease, including cancers of the head and neck. e ability of radiotherapy to reduce and sometimes eradicate cancer was appreciated in the early years of experimentation with the new modality. e use of radia- tion therapy for treatment of cancer of the head and neck was of particular interest because of the frequent morbidity of sur- gical resection of head and neck cancer with the frequent del- eterious e ects on speech and swallowing function as well as cosmesis associated with surgical resection. After many years of improving radiotherapy delivery methods and dose sched- ules, the approach remains attractive today and is frequently preferred, allowing for preservation of speech and swallow- ing function with eradication of disease in many cases. e modality has evolved through the years with the develop- ment of high-energy radiation machines capable of sparing super cial normal tissues; the development of e ective radio- isotopes for interstitial and intracavitary applications; the appreciation of biologic di erences between normal tissues and tumors relative to response to radiation, allowing more optimal radiation dose schedules; the integration of systemic therapies with radiation; and the complex delivery of radio- therapy from multiple orientations and dose modi cations to enhance tumor response with protection of normal tissue. e past 100 years have been extremely exciting in the evolu- tion of radiotherapy as de nitive treatment and as adjuvant therapy for patients with carcinomas of the head and neck, and the eld is currently improving rapidly with continued improvements in technology.},

abstract = {As shown in our previous studies, growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer can be regulated by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been revealed. In this study, a proteomics analysis was performed to compare protein expression treated with and without ADSCs in ovarian cancer cells. Protein levels were altered in ovarian cancer cells due to the treatment of ADSCs. Thymosin beta 4 X-linked (TMSB4X) levels changed dramatically, and this protein was identified as one of the most important candidate molecules contributing to the tumour-promoting effects of ADSCs. Compared with the cells that are cultured in the normal growth medium, the TMSB4X levels cultured in ADSC-conditioned medium increased significantly in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the growth and invasion of cancer cells were decreased, even in the ADSC-conditioned medium treatment group (P{\textless}0.05), by the inhibition of TMSB4X. As shown in the bioluminescence images captured in vivo, increased ovarian cancer's growth and metastasis, along with elevated TMSB4X expression, were observed in the group of ADSC-conditioned medium, and the tumour-promoting effect of ADSCs was attenuated by the inhibition of TMSB4X. Based on our findings, increased TMSB4X expression may play a role in accelerating the ADSC-mediated proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cancers.},

Data Sources: The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) publications, PubMed-based literature review, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Review Methods: TCGA publications, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were queried for genomics and related basic science, preclinical, and developmental clinical precision medicine studies in HNSCC. Results: TCGA reported comprehensive genomic analyses of 279 HNSCC, defining the landscape and frequency of chromosomal copy number alterations, mutations, and expressed genes that contribute to pathogenesis, prognosis, and resistance to therapy. This provides a road map for basic science and preclinical studies to identify key pathways in cancer and cells of the tumor microenvironment affected by these alterations, and candidate targets for new small molecule and biologic therapies. Conclusion: Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, mutations, and expression of genes affecting HNSCC subsets are associated with differences in prognosis, and define molecules, pathways, and deregulated immune responses as candidates for therapy. Activity of molecularly targeted agents appears to be enhanced by rational combinations of these agents and standard therapies targeting the complex alterations that affect multiple pathways and mechanisms in HNSCC.NA.},

Publicly available R packages and in-house scripts were used for genomic array data processing, including normalization, segmentation and CNA calling.

The incidence of chromothripsis in HNSCC was estimated to be 6{\%}, and the chromosome pulverization hotspot regions were detected. We determined 323 genomic locations significantly enriched for breakpoints, which indicate HNSCC-specific genomic instability regions. Unsupervised clustering of genome-wide CNA data revealed a sub-cluster predominantly composed of nasopharynx tumors and presented a large proportion of HPV-positive samples.

abstract = {Identifying robust survival subgroups of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will significantly improve patient care. Currently, endeavor of integrating multi-omics data to explicitly predict HCC survival from multiple patient cohorts is lacking. To fill this gap, we present a deep learning (DL)–based model on HCC that robustly differentiates survival subpopulations of patients in six cohorts. We built the DL-based, survival-sensitive model on 360 HCC patients' data using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), miRNA sequencing (miRNA-Seq), and methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which predicts prognosis as good as an alternative model where genomics and clinical data are both considered. This DL-based model provides two optimal subgroups of patients with significant survival differences (P ¼ 7.13e6) and good model fitness [concordance index (C-index) ¼ 0.68]. More aggressive subtype is associated with frequent TP53 inactivation mutations, higher expression of stemness markers (KRT19 and EPCAM) and tumor marker BIRC5, and activated Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. We validated this multi-omics model on five external datasets of various omics types: LIRI-JP cohort (n ¼ 230, C-index ¼ 0.75), NCI cohort (n ¼ 221, C-index ¼ 0.67), Chinese cohort (n ¼ 166, C-index ¼ 0.69), E-TABM-36 cohort (n ¼ 40, C-index ¼ 0.77), and Hawaiian cohort (n ¼ 27, C-index ¼ 0.82). This is the first study to employ DL to identify multi-omics features linked to the differential survival of patients with HCC. Given its robustness over multiple cohorts, we expect this workflow to be useful at predicting HCC prognosis prediction.},

abstract = {REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospitalized patient care settings. BACKGROUND: Nursing professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. Many of these stressors have always been inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses have been experiencing increased stress related to other factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically attention and memory, and this increases the already high stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very difficult situations that require accurate, timely decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are factors that create scenarios for risk of patient harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses: burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state that nurses experience considerable job stress which has been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this opinion and state that work related stress is largely contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report that work stress leads to a much higher turnover, especially during the first year after graduation, lowering retention rates in general.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43{\%} of the nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11{\%} of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital's staffing level increased burnout by 23{\%}.Depression can be defined as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1{\%} of the nurses' counterparts who do not work in healthcare. High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38{\%}) and Taiwanese nurses (27.7{\%}). In the Taiwanese study the occurrence of depression was significantly and positively correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses (p{\textless}0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression, Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80{\%} more likely to have suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A further finding in this study revealed that 75{\%} of the participants also suffered from at least one chronic disease revealing a strong association between depression and other major health issues.A stressful working environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses as "non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences". Nurse-to-nurse lateral violence leads to negative workplace relationships and disrupts team performance, creating an environment where poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence. According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI) developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI model has been widely used in occupational health settings based on its predictive power for adverse health and well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma {\&} Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model, occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by Reineck {\&} Furino indicated that registered nurses had a very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their profession but that they identified workplace relationships and stress issues as some of the most important contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge, Skogstad {\&} Einarsen state that work-related stress further increases the potential for lateral violence as it creates a negative environment for both the target and the perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as "paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment". The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment awareness. The program has proven to be effective in reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from the general public, the reviewers reported a significant reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups were compared. However, there have been limited studies to date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based interventions can also enhance nurses' capacity for focused attention and concentration by increasing present moment awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in everyday situations as well as stressful situations. According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences people differently based on their viewpoint and their interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective on the connectivity of all things and not operate on automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the best research evidence available pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses.},

With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management "Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- S{\o}ren H{\o}jsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark "Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++.

abstract = {In modern drug discovery, virtual screening is an attractive and cost-effective approach, which is widely applied to filter chemical compound libraries for the identification of novel inhibitors. Epidermal growth factor receptor protein is a well reported anticancer molecular target due to its over expression and mutation in many solid tumours. The decline in epidermal growth factor receptor activity by small molecules has proved to be an effective treatment for cancer. To design inhibitors for this target, the crystal structures information of epidermal growth factor receptors, co-crystallized with its inhibitors, provide a gateway to perform receptor-based drug designing studies, whereas the inhibitors with their biological activity reported in literature provide information to carry out ligand-based drug designing studies. In the present study, the drug designing methods were strategically combined and used parallely on a library of 50,000 drug-like compounds from ChemDiv and ChemBridge database, for the selection of potential inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor. This resulted in the identification of 200 common hits, which were further pruned down to 87, based on the knowledge about the key interaction of known epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors with Met793. These 87 hits were clustered into 12 different structural moieties. In vitro studies of some of these hits were also carried out in order to validate the screening approach. Further, the lead optimization studies were performed by analyzing the binding poses of all the identified structural moieties in order to ascertain the scope of modifications around these moieties. Molecular dynamics simulation studies further revealed some important residues of the target which may be helpful for providing stability to the enzyme-inhibitor complex. These findings could be very much helpful for a medicinal chemist to design a novel potent inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor.},

Materials and methods: A multi-site retrospective chart review was conducted in Europe (Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain), Asia Pacific (Australia, South Korea, Taiwan), and Latin/North America (Brazil and Canada) to identify patients who initiated first-line systemic therapy for R/M HNSCC between January 2011 and December 2013. Patients were followed through December 2015 to collect clinical characteristics, treatment and survival data. Results: Among 733 R/M HNSCC patients across 71 sites, median age was 60 years (inter-quartile range 54–67), 84{\%} male, and 70{\%} Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–1; 32{\%} had oral cavity and 30{\%} oropharyngeal cancers. The most common first-line regimen across all countries consisted of platinum-based combinations (73{\%}), including platinum + 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (26{\%}), cetuximab + platinum ± 5-FU (22{\%}), or taxane + platinum ± 5-FU (16{\%}). However, use of different platinum-based combinations varied substantially; administration of cetuximab + platinum ± 5-FU was frequent in Italy (81{\%}), Germany (46{\%}) and Spain (38{\%}), whereas use in other countries was limited. Median follow-up was 22.6 months (95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 21.5–24.6 months). Median real-world overall survival was only 8.0 months (95{\%} CI: 7.0–8.0), with one-year survival reaching only 30.9{\%} (95{\%} CI: 27.5–34.3). Conclusion: Systemic therapies used in clinical practice for patients with R/M HNSCC vary substantially across countries. Prognosis remains poor in this patient population, highlighting the need for newer, more efficacious treatments.},

•
Many of today's most common, costly, and chronic diseases are stress-related.
•
Mindfulness, as both a dispositional trait and as a skill-based training, can reduce patient-reported symptoms of stress in physical disease.
•
There is little good quality evidence that mindfulness-based interventions impact objective biomarkers of disease severity or progression.
•
Adequate empirical support exists to integrate mindfulness with conventional medical care for many stress-related chronic diseases.
•
Studies should clarify if mindfulness impacts objective disease measures, generalizes to diverse populations, and is effective in non-academic health settings.},

abstract = {Objectives: Perineural invasion (PNI) is a common histopathological finding in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in PNI and the role of PNI as an aggressive pathological feature. Materials and methods: We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to relate the histological presentation of 528 HNSCC tumours to clinical, whole genome expression and proteomic data. Results: We identified a specific gene expression profile highly enriched in genes related to muscle differentiation/function and associated with PNI in HNSCC. We explored the clinical significance of this profile in three groups of HNSCC tumours stratified according to their low, intermediate or high risk of post-surgical recurrence. In the “low-risk” group, defined as tumours indicated for surgery without adjuvant radiotherapy (n = 51), the PNI gene expression profile identified a subset of HNSCC with a higher rate of tumour recurrence, decreased Disease Free Survival (DFS) and Overall Survival (OS) (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.0064, respectively). Comparable results were observed in “intermediate risk” tumours (n = 112), but not in “high risk” tumours (n = 147), whose prognosis was driven by the presence of lymph node extracapsular spread. Finally, we found that tumours with histological PNI had increased activation levels of the Akt/PKB and mTOR (mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) kinases. Conclusion: PNI is characterised by a specific gene expression profile and distinct biological characteristics. Analysing the PNI gene expression profile holds potential for therapeutic stratification of HNSCC and identification of a subset of tumours with a higher risk of recurrence.},

abstract = {Recent initiatives such as The Cancer Genome Atlas have mapped the genome-wide effect of individual genes on tumor growth. By unraveling genomic alterations in tumors, molecular subtypes of cancers have been identified, which is improving patient diagnostics and treatment. Uhlen et al. developed a computer-based modeling approach to examine different cancer types in nearly 8000 patients. They provide an open-access resource for exploring how the expression of specific genes influences patient survival in 17 different types of cancer. More than 900,000 patient survival profiles are available, including for tumors of colon, prostate, lung, and breast origin. This interactive data set can also be used to generate personalized patient models to predict how metabolic changes can influence tumor growth.Science, this issue p. eaan2507INTRODUCTIONCancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and there is great need to define the molecular mechanisms driving the development and progression of individual tumors. The Hallmarks of Cancer has provided a framework for a deeper molecular understanding of cancer, and the focus so far has been on the genetic alterations in individual cancers, including genome rearrangements, gene amplifications, and specific cancer-driving mutations. Using systems-level approaches, it is now also possible to define downstream effects of individual genetic alterations in a genome-wide manner.RATIONALEIn our study, we used a systems-level approach to analyze the transcriptome of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome, based on a genome-wide transcriptomics analysis of {\~{}}8000 individual patients with clinical metadata. The study was made possible through the availability of large open-access knowledge-based efforts such as the Cancer Genome Atlas and the Human Protein Atlas. Here, we used the data to perform a systems-level analysis of 17 major human cancer types, describing both interindividual and intertumor variation patterns.RESULTSThe analysis identified candidate prognostic genes associated with clinical outcome for each tumor type; the results show that a large fraction of cancer protein-coding genes are differentially expressed and, in many cases, have an impact on overall patient survival. Systems biology analyses revealed that gene expression of individual tumors within a particular cancer varied considerably and could exceed the variation observed between distinct cancer types. No general prognostic gene necessary for clinical outcome was applicable to all cancers. Shorter patient survival was generally associated with up-regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell growth and down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. The data allowed us to generate personalized genome-scale metabolic models for cancer patients to identify key genes involved in tumor growth. In addition, we explored tissue-specific genes associated with the dedifferentiation of tumor cells and the role of specific cancer testis antigens on a genome-wide scale. For lung and colorectal cancer, a selection of prognostic genes identified by the systems biology effort were analyzed in independent, prospective cancer cohorts using immunohistochemistry to validate the gene expression patterns at the protein level. CONCLUSIONA Human Pathology Atlas has been created as part of the Human Protein Atlas program to explore the prognostic role of each protein-coding gene in 17 different cancers. Our atlas uses transcriptomics and antibody-based profiling to provide a standalone resource for cancer precision medicine. The results demonstrate the power of large systems biology efforts that make use of publicly available resources. Using genome-scale metabolic models, cancer patients are shown to have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. With more than 900,000 Kaplan-Meier plots, this resource allows exploration of the specific genes influencing clinical outcome for major cancers, paving the way for further in-depth studies incorporating systems-level analyses of cancer. All data presented are available in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow for genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcome in major human cancers.Schematic overview of the Human Pathology Atlas.A systems-level approach enables analysis of the protein-coding genes of 17 different cancer types from {\~{}}8000 patients. Results are available in an interactive open-access database.Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, and there is great interest in understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of individual tumors. We used systems-level approaches to analyze the genome-wide transcriptome of the protein-coding genes of 17 major cancer types with respect to clinical outcome. A general pattern emerged: Shorter patient survival was associated with up-regulation of genes involved in cell growth and with down-regulation of genes involved in cellular differentiation. Using genome-scale metabolic models, we show that cancer patients have widespread metabolic heterogeneity, highlighting the need for precise and personalized medicine for cancer treatment. All data are presented in an interactive open-access database (www.proteinatlas.org/pathology) to allow genome-wide exploration of the impact of individual proteins on clinical outcomes.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms whereby placebo conditioning leads to placebo analgesia remain unclear. In this study we aimed to identify the brain structures activated during placebo conditioning and subsequent placebo analgesia. We induced placebo analgesia by associating a sham treatment with pain reduction and used fMRI to measure brain activity associated with three stages of the placebo response: before, during and after the sham treatment, while participants anticipated and experienced brief laser pain. In the control session participants were explicitly told that the treatment was inactive. The sham treatment group reported a significant reduction in pain rating (p = 0.012). Anticipatory brain activity was modulated during placebo conditioning in a fronto-cingulate network involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial frontal cortex and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC). Identical areas were modulated during anticipation in the placebo analgesia phase with the addition of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, during altered pain experience only aMCC, post-central gyrus and posterior cingulate demonstrated altered activity. The common frontal cortical areas modulated during anticipation in both the placebo conditioning and placebo analgesia phases have previously been implicated in placebo analgesia. Our results suggest that the main effect of placebo arises from the reduction of anticipation of pain during placebo conditioning that is subsequently maintained during placebo analgesia. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

abstract = {Objectives Incidence of oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas is rising worldwide, and population characterization is important to follow for future trends. The aim of this retrospective study was to present a large cohort of primary oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma from all four health regions of Norway, with descriptive clinicopathological characteristics and five-year survival outcomes. Materials and methods Patients diagnosed with primary treatment-na{\"{i}}ve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas at all four university hospitals in Norway between 2005–2009 were retrospectively included in this study. Clinicopathological data from the electronic health records were compared to survival data. Results A total of 535 patients with primary treatment-na{\"{i}}ve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas were identified. The median survival follow-up time was 48 months (range 0–125 months) after treatment. The median five-year overall survival was found to be 47{\%}. Median five-year disease-specific survival was 52{\%}, ranging from 80{\%} for stage I to 33{\%} for stage IV patients. For patients given treatment with curative intent, the overall survival was found to be 56{\%} and disease-specific survival 62{\%}. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range 24–101 years), 64 years for men and 72 years for women. The male: female ratio was 1.2. No gender difference was found in neither tumor status (p = 0.180) nor node status (p = 0.266), but both factors influenced significantly on survival (p{\textless}0.001 for both). Conclusions We present a large cohort of primary treatment-na{\"{i}}ve oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas in Norway. Five-year disease-specific survival was 52{\%}, and patients eligible for curative treatment had a five-year disease-specific survival up to 62{\%}.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human spinal cord to test the hypothesis that placebo analgesia results in a reduction of nociceptive processing in the spinal cord. In line with behavioral data that show decreased pain responses under placebo, pain-related activity in the spinal cord is strongly reduced under placebo. These results provide direct evidence for spinal inhibition as one mechanism of placebo analgesia and highlight that psychological factors can act on the earliest stages of pain processing in the central nervous system.},

We investigated the efficacy of cetuximab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Methods: We randomly assigned 220 of 442 eligible patients with untreated recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck to receive cisplatin (at a dose of 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area on day 1) or carboplatin (at an area under the curve of 5 mg per milliliter per minute, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion on day 1) plus fluorouracil (at a dose of 1000 mg per square meter per day for 4 days) every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles and 222 patients to receive the same chemotherapy plus cetuximab (at a dose of 400 mg per square meter initially, as a 2-hour intravenous infusion, then 250 mg per square meter, as a 1-hour intravenous infusion per week) for a maximum of 6 cycles. Patients with stable disease who received chemotherapy plus cetuximab continued to receive cetuximab until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects, whichever occurred first. Results: Adding cetuximab to platinum-based chemotherapy with fluorouracil (platinum-fluorouracil) significantly prolonged the median overall survival from 7.4 months in the chemotherapy-alone group to 10.1 months in the group that received chemotherapy plus cetuximab (hazard ratio for death, 0.80; 95{\%} confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.99; P = 0.04). The addition of cetuximab prolonged the median progression-free survival time from 3.3 to 5.6 months (hazard ratio for progression, 0.54; P{\textless}0.001) and increased the response rate from 20{\%} to 36{\%} (P{\textless}0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the chemotherapy-alone and cetuximab groups were anemia (19{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively), neutropenia (23{\%} and 22{\%}), and thrombocytopenia (11{\%} in both groups). Sepsis occurred in 9 patients in the cetuximab group and in 1 patient in the chemotherapy-alone group (P = 0.02). Of 219 patients receiving cetuximab, 9{\%} had grade 3 skin reactions and 3{\%} had grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions. There were no cetuximab-related deaths. Conclusions: As compared with platinum-based chemotherapy plus fluorouracil alone, cetuximab plus platinum-fluorouracil chemotherapy improved overall survival when given as first-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

However, client-centred therapy is not usually considered within texts on traumatic stress and questions have been raised over the appropriateness of client-centred therapy with trauma survivors. The present study shows how, although he was writing well before the introduction of the term 'post-traumatic stress disorder', Carl Rogers provided a theory of therapy and personality that contains an account of threat-related psychological processes largely consistent with contemporary trauma theory. Rogers' theory provides the conceptual underpinnings to the client-centred and experiential ways of working with traumatized people. Furthermore, Rogers' theory provides an understanding of post-traumatic growth processes, and encourages therapists to adopt a more positive psychological perspective to their understanding of how people adjust to traumatic events.},

abstract = {In the post-genomic era, many researchers have taken a systematic approach to identifying abnormal genes associated with various diseases. However, the gold standard has not been established, and most of these abnormalities are difficult to be rehabilitated in real clinical settings. In addition to identifying abnormal genes, for a practical purpose, it is necessary to investigate abnormality diversity. In this context, this study is aimed to demonstrate simply restorable genes as useful drug targets. We devised the concept of "drug targetability" to evaluate several different modes of abnormal genes by predicting events after drug treatment. As a representative example, we applied our method to breast cancer. Computationally, PTPRF, PRKAR2B, MAP4K3, and RICTOR were calculated as highly drug-targetable genes for breast cancer. After knockdown of these top-ranked genes (i.e., high drug targetability) using siRNA, our predictions were validated by cell death and migration assays. Moreover, inhibition of RICTOR or PTPRF was expected to prolong lifespan of breast cancer patients according to patient information annotated in microarray data. We anticipate that our method can be widely applied to elaborate selection of novel drug targets, and, ultimately, to improve the efficacy of disease treatment.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to articulate the person-centered approach (PCAp) in theory and in the research and practice of occupational mental health. First, Carl Rogers' person-centered theory was reviewed. Secondly, a study on 1,661 workers was presented in which psychological variables such as fatigue (FG), depression (DP) and anxiety (AX) were found to be negatively correlated with relationship scales concerning the workers' perception of the person-centered attitudes (PCA) of their superiors, the democratic leadership of their superiors (DEM) and the overall activation (ACT) of their worksites. Significant differences in FG, DP and AX were found among workers who perceived of their superiors as having either high or low PCA. Workers who reported that their superiors had high PCA had significantly less FG, DP and AX than those who perceived of their superiors as having low PCA. Similar results were also obtained when high DEM/low DEM and high ACT/low ACT were compared in terms of workers' FG, DP and AX. Thus, the PCA of job superiors was considered to be positively related to the mental health of workers. Thirdly, PCA training in industry was introduced and evaluated. A total of 137 trainees (managers) conducted active listening, a basic skill in the PCAp, and filled out a relationship inventory immediately afterwards, evaluating themselves as listeners and their partners as listeners. A comparison of scores between the first and last sessions of training showed significant increases in empathy, congruence and unconditional positive regard at the last session in both the speakers' version and the listeners' version of the relationship inventory. Cases showing changes in human relations at work as a consequence of PCA training, reported by the trainees and confirmed by an occupational health nurse, were presented. This study showed that PCA, which is positively related to workers' mental health, can increase as a result of training. The implications of these studies are discussed and various possibilities for further research using the concepts of PCAp are presented. The authors hope that such a viewpoint in occupational mental health may lead to fruitful research and practice in the field of occupational medicine. {\textcopyright} 1992, Japan Society for Occupational Health.

Graph- and rule-based analytics have been applied extensively for cancer classification as well as prognosis using large genomic and other data over the past decade. This article provides a comprehensive review of various graph- and rule-based machine learning algorithms that have been applied to numerous genomics data to determine the cancer-specific gene modules, identify gene signature-based classifiers and carry out other related objectives of potential therapeutic value. This review focuses mainly on the methodological design and features of these algorithms to facilitate the application of these graph- and rule-based analytical approaches for cancer classification and prognosis. Based on the type of data integration, we divided all the algorithms into three categories: model-based integration, pre-processing integration and post-processing integration. Each category is further divided into four sub-categories (supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and survival-driven learning analyses) based on learning style. Therefore, a total of 11 categories of methods are summarized with their inputs, objectives and description, advantages and potential limitations. Next, we briefly demonstrate well-known and most recently developed algorithms for each sub-category along with salient information, such as data profiles, statistical or feature selection methods and outputs. Finally, we summarize the appropriate use and efficiency of all categories of graph- and rule mining-based learning methods when input data and specific objective are given.

abstract = {Objective: Surgical resection remains the primary treatment for the majority of solid tumors. Despite efforts to obtain wide margins, close or positive surgical margins ({\textless}5 mm) are found in 15–30{\%} of head and neck cancer patients. Obtaining negative margins requires immediate, intraoperative feedback of margin status. To this end, we propose optical specimen mapping of resected tumor specimens immediately after removal. Materials and methods: A first-in-human pilot study was performed in patients (n = 8) after infusion of fluorescently labeled antibody, panitumumab-IRDye800 to allow surgical mapping of the tumor specimen. Patients underwent standard of care surgical resection for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Optical specimen mapping was performed on the primary tumor specimen and correlated with pathological findings after tissue processing. Results: Optical mapping of the specimen had a 95{\%} sensitivity and 89{\%} specificity to detect cancer within 5 mm (n = 160) of the cut surface. To detect tumor within 2 mm of the specimen surface, the sensitivity of optical specimen mapping was 100{\%}. The maximal observed penetration depth of panitumumab-IRDye800 through human tissue in our study was 6.3 mm. Conclusion: Optical specimen mapping is a highly sensitive and specific method for evaluation of margins within {\textless}5 mm of the tumor mass in HNSCC specimens. This technology has potentially broad applications for ensuring adequate tumor resection and negative margins in head and neck cancers.},

abstract = {A broad range of mind-body therapies (MBTs) are used by the public today, and a growing body of clinical and basic sciences research has resulted in evidence-based integration of many MBTs into clinical practice. Basic sciences research has identified some of the physiological correlates of MBT practices, leading to a better understanding of the processes by which emotional, cognitive and psychosocial factors can influence health outcomes and well-being. In particular, results from functional genomics and neuroimaging describe some of the processes involved in the mind-body connection and how these can influence health outcomes. Functional genomic and neurophysiological correlates of MBTs are reviewed, detailing studies showing changes in sympathetic nervous system activation of gene transcription factors involved in immune function and inflammation, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging studies on MBT practices, and persistent changes in neural function and morphology associated with these practices. While the broad diversity of study designs and MBTs studied presents a patchwork of results requiring further validation through replication and longitudinal studies, clear themes emerge for MBTs as immunomodulatory, with effects on leukocyte transcription and function related to inflammatory and innate immune responses, and neuromodulatory, with effects on brain function and morphology relevant for attention, learning, and emotion regulation. By detailing the potential mechanisms of action by which MBTs may influence health outcomes, the data generated by these studies have contributed significantly towards a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying MBTs.},

abstract = {After separating by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis an extract of total proteins  from human stratum corneum, two spots were extracted and analyzed for their peptide sequence. The resulting internal protein sequences provided evidence for the identification of a new calcium-binding protein. Cloning of the corresponding full-length cDNA was achieved by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using two keratinocyte libraries, one from proliferating cultured keratinocytes and one from differentiated keratinocytes of reconstructed human epidermis. The cDNA had an open reading frame encoding a new calcium-binding protein of 146 amino acids, a member of the calmodulin family. We named this new protein calmodulin-like skin protein (CLSP), since reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction studies of CLSP expression in 10 different human tissues revealed that this protein was particularly abundant in the epidermis where its expression is directly related to keratinocyte differentiation. Expression of the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli yielded a recombinant protein which allowed its further characterization. rCLSP is able to bind calcium, and similarly to calmodulin, exposes thereafter hydrophobic parts which most likely interact with target proteins. Epidermal proteins retained by CaM affinity column are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from those of the rCLSP column. Sequencing of a rCLSP affinity purified protein revealed 100{\%} identity with transglutaminase 3, a key enzyme in terminal differentiation, indicating an important role of CLSP in this process.},

abstract = {Epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) are essential manifestations of epithelial cell plasticity during tumor progression. Transforming growth factor-$\beta$(TGF-$\beta$) modulates epithelial plasticity in tumor physiological contexts by inducing EMT, which is associated with the altered expression of genes. In the present study, we used DNA micro-array analysis to search for differentially expressed genes in the TGF-$\beta$1 induced gallbladder carcinoma cell line (GBC-SD cells), as compared with normal GBC-SD cells. We identified 225 differentially expressed genes, including 144 that were over-expressed and 81 that were under-expressed in the TGF-$\beta$1 induced GBC-SD cells. NT5E (CD73) is the most increased gene, while the Fc fragment of the IgG binding protein (FcGBP) is the most decreased gene. The expression patterns of these two genes in gallbladder adenocarcinoma and chronic cholecystitis tissue were consistent with the micro-array data. Immunochemistry and clinicopathological results showed that the expression of NT5E and FcGBP in gallbladder adenocarcinoma is an independent marker for evaluation of the disease progression, clinical biological behaviors and prognosis. The data from the current study indicate that differential NT5E and FcGBP expressions could be further evaluated as biomarkers for predicting survival of patients with gallbladder cancer and that NT5E and FcGBP could be promising targets in the control of gallbladder cancer progression. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

However, cancers of the various head and neck anatomical sites are specific biological entities. Thus, the aim of the present study was to validate promising prognostic markers for head and neck cancer reported in the Pathology Atlas in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC). We selected three promising markers from the Pathology Atlas (CALML5, CD59, LIMA1), and analyzed their prognostic value in a Norwegian OTSCC cohort comprising 121 patients. We correlated target protein and mRNA expression in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cancer tissue to five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Protein expression of CALML5 and LIMA1 were significantly associated with five-year DSS in the OTSCC cohort in univariate analyses (p = 0.016 and p = 0.043, respectively). In multivariate analyses, lymph node metastases, tumor differentiation, and CALML5 were independent prognosticators. The prognostic role of the other selected markers for head and neck cancer patients identified through unbiased approaches could not be validated in our OTSCC cohort. This underlines the need for subsite-specific analyses for head and neck cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last two decades, some of the neuroanatomical and  neurophysiological substrates of the placebo effect have been elucidated. What has emerged is the multifactorial nature of the placebo effect, such that there is not a single placebo effect but many. Here we report on recent advances in our understanding of this phenomenon, with particular emphasis on its use as an experimental model to better clarify different brain mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: One of the most interesting findings in the past few years is that the placebo effect is a learning phenomenon, which is powerfully influenced by the manipulation of different variables. The involvement of opioid mechanisms is supported by several studies on pain, but also by the exploration of new fields such as memory and cognition. Nonopioid mechanisms have been described as well, for example, in pain, Parkinson's disease and anxiety. Recent evidence confirms and extends previous findings on the key role of prefrontal regions in the placebo response. SUMMARY: The study of the placebo effect is paying dividends and bodes well for the future. Whereas in clinical practice it can increase the efficacy of a therapy, in the experimental setting it represents an excellent tool for neuroscience.},

abstract = {The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual has become the benchmark for classifying patients with cancer, defining prognosis, and determining the best treatment approaches. Many view the primary role of the tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) system as that of a standardized classification system for evaluating cancer at a population level in terms of the extent of disease, both at initial presentation and after surgical treatment, and the overall impact of improvements in cancer treatment. The rapid evolution of knowledge in cancer biology and the discovery and validation of biologic factors that predict cancer outcome and response to treatment with better accuracy have led some cancer experts to question the utility of a TNM-based approach in clinical care at an individualized patient level. In the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the goal of including relevant, nonanatomic (including molecular) factors has been foremost, although changes are made only when there is strong evidence for inclusion. The editorial board viewed this iteration as a proactive effort to continue to build the important bridge from a "population-based" to a more "personalized" approach to patient classification, one that forms the conceptual framework and foundation of cancer staging in the era of precision molecular oncology. The AJCC promulgates best staging practices through each new edition in an effort to provide cancer care providers with a powerful, knowledge-based resource for the battle against cancer. In this commentary, the authors highlight the overall organizational and structural changes as well as "what's new" in the Eighth Edition. It is hoped that this information will provide the reader with a better understanding of the rationale behind the aggregate proposed changes and the exciting developments in the upcoming edition.

abstract = {Single-nucleotide variation and gene expression of disease samples represent important resources for biomarker discovery. Many databases have been built to host and make available such data to the community, but these databases are frequently limited in scope and/or content. BioMuta, a database of cancer-associated single-nucleotide variations, and BioXpress, a database of cancer-associated differentially expressed genes and microRNAs, differ from other disease-associated variation and expression databases primarily through the aggregation of data across many studies into a single source with a unified representation and annotation of functional attributes. Early versions of these resources were initiated by pilot funding for specific research applications, but newly awarded funds have enabled hardening of these databases to production-level quality and will allow for sustained development of these resources for the next few years. Because both resources were developed using a similar methodology of integration, curation, unification, and annotation, we present BioMuta and BioXpress as allied databases that will facilitate a more comprehensive view of gene associations in cancer.

(3) The second person, whom we shall term the therapist, is congruent or integrated in the relationship. (4) The therapist experiences unconditional positive regard for the client. (5) The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experience to the client. (6) The communication to the client of the therapist's empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard is to a minimal degree achieved."

abstract = {High proliferation rate and high mutation density are both indicators of poor prognosis in adrenocortical carcinomas. We performed a hypothesis‐driven association study between clinical features in adrenocortical carcinomas and the expression levels of 136 genes involved in DNA metabolism and G1/S phase transition. In 79 samples downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas portal, high Cyclin Dependent Kinase 6 (CDK6) mRNA levels gave the most significant association with shorter time to relapse and poorer survival of patients. A hierarchical clustering approach assembled most tumors with high levels of CDK6 mRNA into one group. These tumors tend to cumulate mutations activating the Wnt/$\beta$‐catenin pathway and show reduced MIR506 expression. Actually, the level of MIR506 RNA is inversely correlated with the levels of both CDK6 and CTNNB1 (encoding $\beta$‐catenin). Together these results indicate that high CDK6 expression is found in aggressive tumors with activated Wnt/$\beta$‐catenin pathway. Thus we tested the impact of Food and Drug Administration‐approved CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors, namely palbociclib and ribociclib, on SW‐13 and NCI‐H295R cells. While both drugs reduced viability and induced senescence in SW‐13 cells, only palbociclib was effective on the retinoblastoma protein (pRB)‐negative NCI‐H295R cells, by inducing apoptosis. In NCI‐H295R cells, palbociclib induced an increase of the active form of Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3$\beta$ (GSK3$\beta$) responsible for the reduced amount of active $\beta$‐catenin, and altered the amount of AXIN2 mRNA. Taken together, these data underline the impact of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors in treating adrenocortical carcinomas.},

abstract = {The genetic events involved in thyroid carcinogenesis are still incompletely understood. Several rearrangements and mutations of oncogenes have been implicated in the development of thyroid papillary carcinomas, follicular adenomas and carcinomas. However, none of these molecular alterations is suitable either as a general marker for the diagnosis of thyroid carcinomas or to differentiate between thyroid follicular adenomas and carcinomas. In order to identify new genes with altered expression which could serve as such markers, we analyzed RNA from thyroid tumor and normal tissue using a novel technique called restriction-mediated differential display. Several differentially expressed genes were identified, including the gene for IgG Fc binding protein (FcgammaBP). Differential expression of FcgammaBP was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Our experiments showed that IgG Fc binding protein (FcgammaBP) is differentially expressed in normal thyroid tissue, thyroid adenomas and thyroid carcinomas. While the FcgammaBP gene is constitutively expressed in normal thyroid tissue, its expression is significantly increased in follicular thyroid adenomas and significantly decreased in papillary and follicular thyroid carcinomas. Thus, measurement of the expression levels of FcgammaBP in thyroid biopsies might help to make the otherwise difficult distinction between a thyroid follicular adenoma and a follicular carcinoma.},
